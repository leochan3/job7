Soundstripe is a premier music licensing platform used by more than a million creators and professionals globally to level up their creative works, including videos, podcasts and gaming experiences. Launched in 2016 by three professional musicians, the company helps fuel creativity for all types of customers, from amateur social creators to freelance filmmakers and podcasters to the world’s largest agencies and brands, including companies such as Microsoft, Uber, Adobe, Pepsico, Nike and Bud Light, just to name a few.

  

Since its inception, Soundstripe has issued more than 18 million content licenses from its diverse catalog of over 10,000 fully\\-cleared songs and 50,000 song variations, as well as from its catalog of 70,000 sound effects and 100,000 video clips. The company is based in Nashville and its catalog is supported by a roster of award\\-winning creators, including heavy hitters like Sam Barsh (Doja Cat, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, etc), VAULTZ (Lorde, Maggie Rogers, etc), and Elise Solberg (Beyonce, Ellie Goulding, etc).

  

Soundstripe is a 5x winner of the Tennessean’s Top Workplace Award and a certified Great Place to Work. Learn more about us here.

 **The Opportunity**

  

We're seeking an Engineering Manager with deep experience across infrastructure, devops, cloud, and application development to join our fully remote team. While your primary focus will be on building, securing, and operating the robust systems that power Soundstripe, you’ll also be hands\\-on in application development, collaborating across all corners of our product suite.

  

In this fluid and highly collaborative environment, you’ll guide a versatile team responsible for everything from the security and scalability of our core infrastructure, to delivering new features and improvements in our Rails web application, public API for enterprise customers, React Native mobile app, and creative extensions—like our Adobe Premiere tools and Twitch integration. You’ll work side\\-by\\-side with Product and Design, adapting to shifting priorities, and ensuring we deliver secure, reliable, and innovative solutions for all our users. If you’re a proactive, adaptable leader who thrives on variety, drives accountability, and values strong engineering culture in a distributed setting, we’d love to meet you.

  

How you’ll make an impact:

  

* Champion both the big picture and the small details—leading and supporting a team of engineers building and maintaining the vital infrastructure behind our products and services.
* Dig into code, config, and best practices when needed. You’re comfortable moving between architecting the next system, reviewing a pull request, and jumping into an incident call.
* Guide your team through technical challenges; whether it’s deploying a new cloud service, scaling our databases, or tightening security.
* Lead effective, high\\-trust project planning, milestone delivery, and sprint execution, always looking for ways to make work smoother and more reliable.
* Be the guardian of operational excellence: implement, monitor, and continually improve our infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and security posture.
* Own our security practices. You’ll oversee everything from incident response to security audits, and help create a culture where everyone knows how to keep our apps and data safe.
* Inspire your team to grow: coach, mentor, perform reviews, and foster an environment of curiosity, learning, and honest feedback.
* Collaborate deeply with Product and Design, partnering on everything from feature planning to launch, and ensuring engineering’s voice is heard in every conversation.
* Contribute ideas, process improvements, technical guidance, and your unique energy in a fully remote, distributed environment.

  


**Who Will Love This Job**

  

A systems thinker and a fixer. You see the whole playing field. You get a kick out of connecting dots and jumping into thorny problems; be it a tricky SQL query, a critical incident, or a cross\\-team product launch.

  

A curious innovator. You never settle for “that’s how we’ve always done it.” You actively look for ways to improve performance, security, and workflow for everyone on your team.

  

A devops\\-minded leader. You are as comfortable talking about Rails best practices as you are discussing firewalls, cloud service orchestration, or load balancer configs.

  

A clear, open communicator. You can break down technical concepts for non\\-engineers and facilitate honest, constructive conversations in a remote team.

  

A coach at heart. You’re excited to see others grow, and you love making your team feel seen, supported, and challenged.

  

A calm operator. When infrastructure quirks or security alerts threaten to throw a wrench in things, you keep your cool and inspire the same steady focus in others.

  

A culture champion. You lead with empathy, humility, and optimism. You genuinely care about the mission, the quality of our work, and the people you work with.

  

A passion for our stack. Deep Rails experience is a must; if you love working up and down the stack, even better.

  

And of course, you value what we value:


* Provide all customers with genuine and whimsical care.
* Confront harsh realities with optimism.
* Keep it light.
* Learn \\& grow.
* Clear communication is kind.
* Make it better.
* Date the model, marry the mission.
* Be humble.
* Quality over quantity.
* Done is better than perfect.

  


**What to Expect**

  

As an Engineering Manager focused on infrastructure, security, compliance, and application development, you’ll help guide key areas that keep Soundstripe’s products running safely and smoothly. You’ll be joining a high\\-performing, good\\-natured, and adaptable team that values collaboration and works closely with Product, Design, and stakeholders from all parts of the company. We take our work seriously but keep the atmosphere light, celebrating wins (big and small), sharing the occasional meme, and always supporting each other along the way.



Soundstripe is a remote\\-first company with a geographically distributed team. We collaborate daily using Slack, Zoom, and GitHub, which helps us stay connected and productive no matter which time zone we are in. Although there are a few chances for in\\-person meetups each year, most of our work and teamwork happens virtually, and everyone is valued as an important part of the team.

 **What You Bring**

  

* Chances are, you’ve seen your share of launch celebrations and production fire drills—maybe that’s about a decade’s worth of hands\\-on experience designing, building, and supporting real\\-world web applications and the infrastructure behind them.
* Ruby on Rails? You not only speak its language, you think in it. (We do too; it’s the heart of our stack.) Sure, you probably have some other languages under your belt, but you’re happiest when Rails is home base.
* You’re no stranger to the essentials: Git, GitHub, and version control best practices are second nature to you. If you’ve ever rescued a teammate from a gnarly merge conflict, you’ll fit right in.
* You love working with APIs; integrating with third parties, revamping our endpoints, documenting for partners, and making sure our own Soundstripe API keeps purring for enterprise customers.
* Cloud\\-native? Absolutely. You’ve spun up servers on Ubuntu (or cousins), wrangled databases (Postgres fans, take a bow), tinkered with GitHub Actions, and kept deployments running smoothly. Bonus points if you smile at the words “load balancer” or “server tuning.”
* Network devices don’t scare you. If anything, you’ve configured your share of firewalls, routers, switches, or caught a bug hiding in a DNS record.
* You have a “safety first” reflex. Whether it’s responding to security incidents or nudging a teammate to enable 2FA, you take security seriously, but you know how to make it approachable for your team.
* Working with product managers, designers, and everyone who cares about our users is something you enjoy. You see the big picture and help connect the dots across disciplines.
* Remote work isn’t new to you. Whether you’re in your home office, a coffee shop, or halfway across the country from your team, you know how to communicate, collaborate, and keep projects humming along.
* And finally, you know your way around modern cloud environments—whether it’s DigitalOcean, AWS, Cloud66, or Fastly, you’re comfortable building and operating production systems on these platforms, and you aren’t fazed by the rapidly changing toolchain and migrations.

  



If any of this resonates with you, we’d love to hear from you! Even more so if you also:

  

* Have dipped your toes (or dived in headfirst) into operating in PCI or GDPR\\-compliant environments and know what it takes to keep things safe and auditable for everyone.
* Are already teaming up with Large Language Models or AI agents. Maybe you’re using them to write and review code, whip up documentation, supercharge testing, automate configs, brainstorm product ideas, or just make your day a little easier.
* Can show us your favorite agile moves—whether you’re a longtime fan of scrum, kanban, shape\\-up, or something you invented to help teams move a little faster, smarter, and happier.

  



If you’ve made it this far and think, “Hey, that sounds a bit like me!” (even if you don’t check every single box), don’t be shy, say hello! We’re a team that’s serious about our craft but not about ourselves. If you’re passionate, curious, and ready to join a group that works hard, laughs often, and genuinely enjoys building cool things together, we can’t wait to meet you.

* Strong project management skills with a proven ability to drive complex initiatives from ambiguity to clarity, aligning cross\\-functional stakeholders without formal authority
* Product mindset with comfort in roadmap planning, sprint cycles, prioritization trade\\-offs, and delivering customer impact
* Familiarity with APIs, Retool, or similar internal platforms; able to scope technical work and partner effectively with engineers
* Strong user empathy and storytelling instincts—you think not just about how the demo works, but what it communicates and how it feels
* Experience translating technical features into clear demo narratives, fixture datasets, and scalable selling assets
* Clear, concise communicator with strong documentation practices and a track record of stakeholder alignment
* Exposure to customer\\-facing roles or enterprise sales cycles, with a deep appreciation for the challenges and expectations of Ramp’s prospects and customers

As a Product Manager on the Uber Grocery \\& Retail Restricted Items team, you'll play a key role in achieving our mission of unlocking the biggest selection and delivering the best\\-in\\-class shopping experience for our restricted item categories, empowering our customers, delivery partners, and merchants to seamlessly, safely and compliantly purchase, deliver, and sell these products on the Eats Marketplace.

* Optimize how we surface restricted items in the customer shopping journey \\- through search, browse, promotions, and merchandising \\- how can we maximize the discoverability and orderability of restricted items while still being socially responsible and adhering to regional regulations?
* Collaborate closely with regional operations and business partners in order to understand the local regulations and pain points related to restricted items, then synthesize the feedback across global markets to develop a strategic product roadmap to solve them
* Ideate on and implement innovative and effective ways to strengthen age verification flows to deter minor delivery and discourage Earner non\\-compliant behaviors, improving our global compliance rates
* Ensure the end\\-to\\-end reliability and success of trips that contain restricted items
* Optimize how merchants onboard and configure their catalogs for restricted items, maximizing the orderability and selection of these products
Influence and collaborate with various product teams across Uber that we depend on in order to ensure compliant deliveries of restricted items (ie. Search, Earner Experience, Fulfillment)  
* 

  

  

**Basic Qualifications**  

  

* Minimum 3\\-5 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them
Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands\\-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the meta  
* 

  

  

**Preferred Qualifications**  

  

* Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process

Chalk is building the data platform that powers the future of machine learning applications. We tear down complexity, latency, and scale barriers that have traditionally constrained ML capabilities. Our platform combines Rust\\-speed performance with elegant tools that developers love to use. Leading companies depend on Chalk for everything from stopping fraudulent credit card swipes, verifying identities, and maximizing clean energy capture. We've recently raised a $50 million Series A, led by Felicis.


**About the role**



We're looking for our **Founding Product Designer** to help define how engineers, data scientists, and ML practitioners interact with Chalk across our web and CLI tools.



As a founding designer, you'll join us full\\-time, in\\-office, and early—shaping not just our product, but our visual language, interaction patterns, and design standards from the ground up.



You'll collaborate with Chalk's founders, engineers, and customers to turn complex data infrastructure and workflows into clean, intuitive interfaces. If you love turning gnarly back\\-end power into smooth front\\-end magic and are eager to deliver designs weekly, we'd love to meet you.


**We work in\\-person Monday through Friday in our SF office. We don't currently offer remote or hybrid positions.**


**What you will do**


* Work directly with engineers and founders to navigate the problem space, define requirements, prototype solutions, and ship polished experiences (we do not have product managers)
* Own UI/UX end\\-to\\-end, from concept to high\\-fidelity mocks to implementation
* Actively gather feedback from peers and users (mostly engineers and data scientists) to validate designs and rapidly iterate
* Balance speed and polish, with a bias to making pragmatic trade\\-offs to ship fast and learn
* Help start the design system: components, patterns, and principles that scale with the team
* Within your first 7 days, ship designs ready for implementation


**What we're looking for**


* 3\\+ years of full\\-time design experience
* Portfolio that showcases shipped work
* Comfort building for an engineering persona, with enough technical literacy to discuss APIs, data flows, and constraints
* A collaborative mindset – low ego about your designs and open to feedback
* Strong communication skills – articulate design decisions clearly and ask clarifying questions to align on context or feedback
* Ability to work autonomously in a fast\\-paced environment, where ""just enough process"" is the goal and without a formal PM structure or formal product documentation
* Fluent in Figma


**Bonus points**


* Experience designing for developer tools or data\\-heavy B2B products
* Familiarity with SQL, Python, data engineering, or machine\\-learning workflows
* Dabbled with front\\-end code (HTML/CSS, React, or TypeScript)


**Benefits**


* ️Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance



 Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Health Savings Account (HSA)



 Expert Healthcare Guidance



 Retirement savings



15 company holidays each year



️15 days of personal time off each year



 Flex Commuter Benefits

Office is fully\\-stocked with drinks and snacks to fuel your work day.



️ Staying late? Dinner is on us



 Staying even later? Grab an Uber / Lyft home on Chalk


**Compensation**


**Range: Salary \\+ Equity based on experience**



Actual compensation awarded to successful candidates will be based on several factors, including individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process.



Our comprehensive total package plays a major role in how we recognize individuals for the impact they will have on Chalk's growth and us achieving our goals.



Chalk offers early team member equity and competitive benefits package in addition to the cash compensation.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a travel fintech provider, commerce platform, and global travel agency that powers some of the world’s largest brands.


Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\\-to\\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada, and many more.


Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


	+ Billions of dollars worth of travel and travel fintech are sold through Hopper and HTS’ channels every year.
	+ Our fintech products – including Cancel for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\\-questions\\-asked resolutions.
	+ Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines and many more.

By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.


The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. he Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.


While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a travel fintech provider, commerce platform, and global travel agency that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

	+ Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders.

Headquartered out of Denver, CO, Spekit is transforming how B2B revenue teams learn, work, and grow. We're building the next\\-generation enablement platform for the AI era, delivering just\\-in\\-time, personalized enablement, and relevant guidance directly within the daily workflows of sales, customer success, and other crucial revenue teams. Our AI\\-powered solution empowers companies like Southwest Airlines, Uber Freight, and ZoomInfo to close more deals, accelerate rep ramp times, and ultimately boost revenue by ensuring their people always have the information they need, precisely when they need it. Say goodbye to information overload and hello to *Simple, yet Spektacular* performance.  

About the Role
Reporting directly to our CEO, Melanie Fellay, we’re adding a *brand new* role to the team! We’re looking for a Go\\-to\\-Market (GTM) Enablement Architect to be a bridge between solutions consulting, revenue enablement, and operational efficiency for our sales team. This role will be critical in ensuring our internal enablement programs are world\\-class and helping our sales team deliver compelling, high\\-impact demos to prospects and customers.  

  

As a power user of Spekit, you’ll take full ownership of our org, continuously optimizing it to showcase our latest capabilities. You’ll also enable our revenue team (including pre and post sales teams), equipping them with the messaging, training, and best practices to excel in their roles. And finally, you’ll directly support sales—helping reps craft the perfect demo strategy or even jumping into calls to lead the demo yourself if needed.  

If you’re a former seller with a passion for enablement, an eye for optimization \\& process, and a love for helping teams \\& customers perform at their best, this role is for you. *Want to see how Melanie describes the role?* *Here*
### **What You’ll Do**

* **Own Internal Enablement and Champion Spekit Internally :** You'll ensure our own team uses Spekit to its absolute highest standard, making us our own **best\\-in\\-class users**. This means driving daily adoption of Spekit's JIT learning across all our GTM teams, so every rep and CSM can genuinely say: ""Spekit helps me learn, work, and close faster, and it's impossibly easy to use."" You'll foster an environment where our team is proud to showcase our internal use of Spekit on any customer call and one where Spekit is used internally for every enablement need, from Onboarding to Product Launch.
* **Elevate Content \\& Enablement Excellence:** You'll continuously keep internal training and content fresh, ensuring our team follows best practices and is always equipped with the latest messaging and competitive positioning. This includes creating and managing impactful product demo videos that resonate with customers and prospects. You'll partner closely with Product Marketers and Product Managers to embed new messaging and sales processes into our enablement.
* **Architect World\\-Class Demos \\& Drive Product Storytelling:** You'll own and continuously evolve our demo environment, transforming it into a **world\\-class showcase** of Spekit's cutting\\-edge capabilities. This involves building compelling, up\\-to\\-date demo use cases that highlight our latest product innovations and effectively convey Spekit's value. You'll lead demo certifications and ongoing training for the sales team, ensuring they master the art of the Spekit demo.
* **Act as a Strategic Sales Advisor \\& In\\-Call Catalyst:** You'll be a trusted advisor to the sales team, partnering with them to refine their approach ahead of key calls. You're not afraid to **jump into critical sales calls** to deliver high\\-impact demos, helping reps navigate complex conversations and confidently position Spekit. You'll proactively listen to call recordings (beyond AI summaries) to truly ""hear"" objections and identify nuanced enablement needs.
* **Uncover Insights \\& Optimize Performance:** You'll manage and optimize Spekit's internal use, ensuring strategic alignment and consistency across teams. You've got serious ""ops chops"" and a love for data, enabling you to pull your own reports and dive deep into performance metrics. You'll obsess over ""what's working"" and ""what isn't"" to deeply understand the root causes of performance challenges, translating data into actionable enablement strategies.

By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.


The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. he Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.


While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a travel fintech provider, commerce platform, and global travel agency that powers some of the world’s largest brands.


Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\\-to\\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada, and many more.

* Our fintech products – including Cancel for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\\-questions\\-asked resolutions.

* Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.


Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines and many more.

 **More about Hopper**


At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.


The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. he Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.


While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a travel fintech provider, commerce platform, and global travel agency that powers some of the world’s largest brands.


Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\\-to\\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada, and many more.


Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

* Billions of dollars worth of travel and travel fintech are sold through Hopper and HTS’ channels every year.
* Our fintech products – including Cancel for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\\-questions\\-asked resolutions.

* Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.


Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines and many more.

  

Hopper has been named the \\#1 most innovative company in travel by Fast Company Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \\#3 largest online travel agencies in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\\-Z and millennials travelers.

  

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. HTS is primed to continue its growth as the leading travel ecommerce provider in a $1 trillion online shopping category. The Hopper app and website will also continue to be the preferred travel provider for Gen Z and Millennials..

=========================


Intro is growing our team of amazing people who are on a mission to **give everyone access to anyone, empowering each other to create a better world**. Intro started in 2022 by first building a tool for the world’s top founders and experts, enabling their audiences from all over the world to be able to access them, jump on a live video call, and get personalized advice. We were (and still are) grateful to see that it was an INSTANT hit.


Today, we have over 20k five star ️️️️️ reviews, and the founders of Reddit, Zillow, Sweetgreen, DryBar, and 1k\\+ more all became partners, as well as advocates of our product, company, and mission. We then launched a marketplace, chat, subscriptions, and more, each leading to faster growth.


We’re just getting started — the Intro of tomorrow will look very different than the Intro of today. In fact, we’re confident that Intro will become the go\\-to network for access, knowledge, and…(we can’t say the last part just yet), all over the world.


If you’re interested in joining an amazing company that is growing (fast), loved by its users, and deeply cares about quality, we’d love to meet you.

On your first day, we’ll do a few exercises to help you identify your life goals. We’ll ask questions like “what do you imagine your life looking like if you achieved all of your goals” and “why are those goals important to you?” Once we identify these, they become our goals and we will work together to help make them a reality.


Next, we’ll ask you about things that matter to you in the short term. These could be things like a gym membership, meditation classes, or an allowance to attend concerts. It’s an open ended exercise and we’ll come up with a perks package that makes you feel valued. Please note, we cannot yet buy you a ticket on a SpaceX rocket. It’s been asked!


Finally, here are the things you’ll definitely get: competitive salary, equity (you become an owner of the business), health insurance, apple equipment, company trips and events, allowances, flexible vacation days, flexible sick days, recharge days, and more.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Intro-28e31de4","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ramp has been named to Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list and LinkedIn’s Top U.S. Startups for more than 3 years, as well as the Forbes Cloud 100, CNBC Disruptor 50, and TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential Companies.

 **About the Role**


Ramp is one of the fastest growing startups in history. Much of that success comes down to how fast we build. Our engineers ship features in days, not months – and fix bugs in hours, not weeks. We move at High.Speed.Velocity and take our work, not ourselves, seriously. Now, we're ready for someone who can tell a story capturing it all. That's where you come in.


We’re looking for our first Product and Partner Communications hire at Ramp, reporting to the Head of Communications. This role comes with a lot of freedom and responsibility. While you won’t be building from scratch, there’s a lot to get creative around.


Our ideal candidate is someone who is a product manager at heart (and just so happens to be amazing at the written word). Your best day is one where you capture the essence of what a product is about so that customers, analysts, and employees understand its true value. You move fast but methodically: you know how to balance building a long\\-term narrative with executing quickly in the here and now. And you’re multilingual, able to speak the language of engineers, customers, product leads, and analysts. If you have fintech experience, that’s a massive plus.


If this sounds like you, we’d love to talk!


This role is ideally based out of either New York, San Francisco, or Miami – but is open to remote.

**What You’ll Do**

* Product and partner communications
	+ Own the creation of our product and partner narrative, developing messaging that clearly communicates Ramp’s value proposition to our key audiences.
	+ Collaborate with Product, Product/Partner Marketing, and Engineering to build a launch calendar and set of criteria for communicating new products, features, and partner momentum.
	+ Identify high\\-impact media opportunities and secure placements in relevant outlets for our audiences.
	+ Build strong relationships with key journalists and social media influencers.
	+ Collaborate with the rest of Communications and Brand Marketing to create written, visual, and video content that makes product news fun and memorable (let’s get some personality in there!).
	+ Prepare executives and subject matter experts ahead of media or speaking engagements.
* Analyst relations
	+ Build an AR program that ensures strong performance in core areas and helps us expand to additional market categories.
	+ Identify and engage with key industry analysts and firms. Establish and nurture strong relationships through regular updates, briefings, and events.
	+ Prepare Ramp executives for analyst interactions with briefing materials and key messaging.
	+ Leverage analyst feedback internally to inform communications, sales enablement, product marketing, and development.
	+ Analyze the impact of AR activities on market perception and business outcomes.

**What You Need**

* 8\\+ years experience in communications or related fields.
* Succinct writing skills that infuse personality and humanity (i.e., you write like people talk).
* High technical acumen.
* Experience in or high desire to learn about fintech.
* A creative spirit, with an ability to story\\-tell across mediums, including video, visual design, and the written word.

**Nice to Haves**

* Experience in video production, editing, or graphic design.
* Experience in analyst relations.

**Compensation**

*For candidates located in NYC or SF, the pay range for this role is $158,500 \\- $217,900\\.*

*For candidates located in all other locations, the pay range for this role is $142,600 \\- $196,150\\.*

**Benefits (for U.S.\\-based full\\-time employees)**

* 100% medical, dental \\& vision insurance coverage for you
	+ Partially covered for your dependents
	+ One Medical annual membership
* 401k (including employer match on contributions made while employed by Ramp)
* Flexible PTO
* Fertility HRA (up to $5,000 per year)
* WFH stipend to support your home office needs
* Wellness stipend
* Parental Leave
* Relocation support to NYC or SF
* Pet insurance

As a Product Manager on the Uber Grocery Delivery Experience team, you'll play a key role in creating a flawless fulfillment experience that gets customers anything they order from local merchants. Uber to date has successfully helped customers get restaurant food delivered to their doors, and we are excited to bring that delight and convenience to virtually everything else.
  

  

Today, we're focused on the grocery, convenience, and alcohol sectors, while expanding into more verticals like retail. Customers demand that their orders arrive accurately, on\\-time and with minimal interventions on their part. To accomplish this, you will define and execute the product strategy to ensure that the shopper experience is simple, while prioritizing accuracy and quality \\- every time.
  

  

In this role, you will be working with a broad set of cross\\-functional stakeholders across operations, data science, design, engineering, marketing and more, to deliver a reliable and delightful shopping experience.
  

  

**What the Candidate Will Do**  

  

The opportunities to evolve the shopper experience are myriad and we are only just getting started. This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling together with the team you're leading:
  

* Understand the needs of our Earners, potential Earners, as well as various lines of business to define the vision, strategy, and roadmap for your product area
* Ensure that couriers are sufficiently prepared to handle complex orders and be able to provide them live support in a scaled, tech\\-driven way while they are shopping and delivering
* Be a thought leader for ways to ensure fulfillment success across all levers, from pricing and incentives to courier education, rewards and data transparency
* Collaborating with our regional operations and sales teams to deeply understand the market nuances and pain\\-points related to fulfillment \\- and then devising and executing product solutions to solve them
Influencing the product roadmaps of many other teams across Uber that work to onboard Earners, manage their trip experience and match them with orders  
* 

  

  

**Basic Qualifications**  

  

* Minimum 3 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them

As Uber Eats has grown from a restaurant only business to selling everything from groceries to flowers, our Catalog system has had to evolve significantly. Catalog Quality is critical to help:

* Make it easy for Shoppers to locate, select, and deliver the correct products
* Make it easy for CPGs to advertise their products and have the best possible performance
* Make it easy for Merchants to understand performance and manage and grow their business

As Uber expands into Grocery and Retail, we need to build a massive product catalog that is highly accurate so that our customers have confidence in what they're buying, our shoppers accurately fulfill the right products, and merchants achieve the sales growth they are looking for. You will be responsible for partnering with global teams around the company to understand how the catalog can power each experience and develop a strategy to grow and enrich Uber's product catalog.
  

  

This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling together with the team you're leading:

* Uncover new sources for product catalog data and develop strategies to reconcile and integrate these diverse sources effectively
* Work with Uber AI to explore ML \\& LLM's to curate the product catalog
* Partner with Ops to design and implement scalable human\\-in\\-the\\-loop processes for auditing and enhancing the accuracy of the product catalog
* Power intelligent user experiences by accurately identifying billions of products globally and mapping the intricate relationships between them.

**Basic Qualifications*** Minimum 3 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them
* E\\-Commerce, Grocery, and/or Retail Catalog and/or Inventory management Experience. You would have directly built products to support product catalogs or inventory management systems.

**Preferred Qualifications*** + Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands\\-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers.
	+ Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process
	+ Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner's problems
	+ Finger\\-tippiness with data. You find a way to get the data you need and whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage this data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis
	+ Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands\\-on
	+ A high bar across the board \\- from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on
