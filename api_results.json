But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard\\-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.\n\n **We're changing that.** AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation \u2014 modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way \u2014 offering them world\\-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. **Our customers enable our modern economy \u2014** ***they deserve it*****.**\n\n  \n\nOur history and background\n\n\nOur founding team has backgrounds in payments, working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, and building apps that were featured on the Apple app store.

Expect to own a particular area of our business, collaborate with teammates across Engineering, Sales, and Customer Success, and leverage your analytical toolkit on a daily basis. The particular problem you'll work on when you join depends on both business needs \\+ your particular strengths and interests. This is a great generalist role to get exposure to all elements of building a high\\-growth company \\- from on\\-the\\-ground operations to big\\-picture strategy.\n\n **In this role you might work on:**\n\n* Determining vertical\\-specific KPIs\n* Optimizing our growth funnel, pre\\-and post\\-sales\n* Building a process playbook for our sales, underwriting, or support teams\n* Running experiments to increase our growth or revenue\n* Analyzing purchase or payments data and using the results to make business decisions\n* Conducting interviews with customers to inform product decisions (and then working with the engineering team to implement)\n\n**What we're looking for:**\n\n* 1\\-3 years of experience in management consulting, strategy, at a high\\-growth startup, or in a heavily analytical role is a plus\n* We are open to different experience levels for this role; your exact responsibilities and scope will match the experience you bring to the table\n* Proficiency in data analysis (SQL, Python, or R); you don't need to know SQL when you join, but expect to learn quickly!\n\n**Offer Details:**\n\n* Hybrid role in either New York or San Francisco\n* Competitive salary commensurate with experience\n* Great benefits and 401(k) match\n* Competitive equity",

Launched in 2016 by three professional musicians, the company helps fuel creativity for all types of customers, from amateur social creators to freelance filmmakers and podcasters to the world\u2019s largest agencies and brands, including companies such as Microsoft, Uber, Adobe, Pepsico, Nike and Bud Light, just to name a few.\n\n  \n\nSince its inception, Soundstripe has issued more than 18 million content licenses from its diverse catalog of over 10,000 fully\\-cleared songs and 50,000 song variations, as well as from its catalog of 70,000 sound effects and 100,000 video clips. The company is based in Nashville and its catalog is supported by a roster of award\\-winning creators, including heavy hitters like Sam Barsh (Doja Cat, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, etc), VAULTZ (Lorde, Maggie Rogers, etc), and Elise Solberg (Beyonce, Ellie Goulding, etc).\n\n  \n\nSoundstripe is a 5x winner of the Tennessean\u2019s Top Workplace Award and a certified Great Place to Work. Learn more about us here.\n\n **The Opportunity**\n\n  \n\nWe're seeking an Engineering Manager with deep experience across infrastructure, devops, cloud, and application development to join our fully remote team. While your primary focus will be on building, securing, and operating the robust systems that power Soundstripe, you\u2019ll also be hands\\-on in application development, collaborating across all corners of our product suite.\n\n  \n\nIn this fluid and highly collaborative environment, you\u2019ll guide a versatile team responsible for everything from the security and scalability of our core infrastructure, to delivering new features and improvements in our Rails web application, public API for enterprise customers, React Native mobile app, and creative extensions\u2014like our Adobe Premiere tools and Twitch integration. You\u2019ll work side\\-by\\-side with Product and Design, adapting to shifting priorities, and ensuring we deliver secure, reliable, and innovative solutions for all our users. If you\u2019re a proactive, adaptable leader who thrives on variety, drives accountability, and values strong engineering culture in a distributed setting, we\u2019d love to meet you.\n\n  \n\nHow you\u2019ll make an impact:\n\n  \n\n* Champion both the big picture and the small details\u2014leading and supporting a team of engineers building and maintaining the vital infrastructure behind our products and services.\n* Dig into code, config, and best practices when needed. You\u2019re comfortable moving between architecting the next system, reviewing a pull request, and jumping into an incident call.\n* Guide your team through technical challenges; whether it\u2019s deploying a new cloud service, scaling our databases, or tightening security.\n* Lead effective, high\\-trust project planning, milestone delivery, and sprint execution, always looking for ways to make work smoother and more reliable.\n* Be the guardian of operational excellence: implement, monitor, and continually improve our infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and security posture.\n* Own our security practices. You\u2019ll oversee everything from incident response to security audits, and help create a culture where everyone knows how to keep our apps and data safe.\n* Inspire your team to grow: coach, mentor, perform reviews, and foster an environment of curiosity, learning, and honest feedback.\n* Collaborate deeply with Product and Design, partnering on everything from feature planning to launch, and ensuring engineering\u2019s voice is heard in every conversation.\n* Contribute ideas, process improvements, technical guidance, and your unique energy in a fully remote, distributed environment.\n\n  \n\n\n**Who Will Love This Job**\n\n  \n\nA systems thinker and a fixer. You see the whole playing field. You get a kick out of connecting dots and jumping into thorny problems; be it a tricky SQL query, a critical incident, or a cross\\-team product launch.\n\n  \n\nA curious innovator. You never settle for \u201cthat\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done it.\u201d You actively look for ways to improve performance, security, and workflow for everyone on your team.\n\n  \n\nA devops\\-minded leader. You are as comfortable talking about Rails best practices as you are discussing firewalls, cloud service orchestration, or load balancer configs.\n\n  \n\nA clear, open communicator. You can break down technical concepts for non\\-engineers and facilitate honest, constructive conversations in a remote team.\n\n  \n\nA coach at heart. You\u2019re excited to see others grow, and you love making your team feel seen, supported, and challenged.\n\n  \n\nA calm operator. When infrastructure quirks or security alerts threaten to throw a wrench in things, you keep your cool and inspire the same steady focus in others.\n\n  \n\nA culture champion. You lead with empathy, humility, and optimism. You genuinely care about the mission, the quality of our work, and the people you work with.\n\n  \n\nA passion for our stack. Deep Rails experience is a must; if you love working up and down the stack, even better.\n\n  \n\nAnd of course, you value what we value:\n\n\n* Provide all customers with genuine and whimsical care.\n* Confront harsh realities with optimism.\n* Keep it light.\n* Learn \\& grow.\n* Clear communication is kind.\n* Make it better.\n* Date the model, marry the mission.\n* Be humble.\n* Quality over quantity.\n* Done is better than perfect.\n\n  \n\n\n**What to Expect**\n\n  \n\nAs an Engineering Manager focused on infrastructure, security, compliance, and application development, you\u2019ll help guide key areas that keep Soundstripe\u2019s products running safely and smoothly. You\u2019ll be joining a high\\-performing, good\\-natured, and adaptable team that values collaboration and works closely with Product, Design, and stakeholders from all parts of the company. We take our work seriously but keep the atmosphere light, celebrating wins (big and small), sharing the occasional meme, and always supporting each other along the way.\n\n\n\nSoundstripe is a remote\\-first company with a geographically distributed team. We collaborate daily using Slack, Zoom, and GitHub, which helps us stay connected and productive no matter which time zone we are in. Although there are a few chances for in\\-person meetups each year, most of our work and teamwork happens virtually, and everyone is valued as an important part of the team.\n\n **What You Bring**\n\n  \n\n* Chances are, you\u2019ve seen your share of launch celebrations and production fire drills\u2014maybe that\u2019s about a decade\u2019s worth of hands\\-on experience designing, building, and supporting real\\-world web applications and the infrastructure behind them.\n* Ruby on Rails? You not only speak its language, you think in it. (We do too; it\u2019s the heart of our stack.) Sure, you probably have some other languages under your belt, but you\u2019re happiest when Rails is home base.\n* You\u2019re no stranger to the essentials: Git, GitHub, and version control best practices are second nature to you. If you\u2019ve ever rescued a teammate from a gnarly merge conflict, you\u2019ll fit right in.\n* You love working with APIs; integrating with third parties, revamping our endpoints, documenting for partners, and making sure our own Soundstripe API keeps purring for enterprise customers.\n* Cloud\\-native? Absolutely. You\u2019ve spun up servers on Ubuntu (or cousins), wrangled databases (Postgres fans, take a bow), tinkered with GitHub Actions, and kept deployments running smoothly. Bonus points if you smile at the words \u201cload balancer\u201d or \u201cserver tuning.\u201d\n* Network devices don\u2019t scare you. If anything, you\u2019ve configured your share of firewalls, routers, switches, or caught a bug hiding in a DNS record.\n* You have a \u201csafety first\u201d reflex. Whether it\u2019s responding to security incidents or nudging a teammate to enable 2FA, you take security seriously, but you know how to make it approachable for your team.\n* Working with product managers, designers, and everyone who cares about our users is something you enjoy. You see the big picture and help connect the dots across disciplines.\n* Remote work isn\u2019t new to you. Whether you\u2019re in your home office, a coffee shop, or halfway across the country from your team, you know how to communicate, collaborate, and keep projects humming along.\n* And finally, you know your way around modern cloud environments\u2014whether it\u2019s DigitalOcean, AWS, Cloud66, or Fastly, you\u2019re comfortable building and operating production systems on these platforms, and you aren\u2019t fazed by the rapidly changing toolchain and migrations.\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, we\u2019d love to hear from you! Even more so if you also:\n\n  \n\n* Have dipped your toes (or dived in headfirst) into operating in PCI or GDPR\\-compliant environments and know what it takes to keep things safe and auditable for everyone.\n* Are already teaming up with Large Language Models or AI agents. Maybe you\u2019re using them to write and review code, whip up documentation, supercharge testing, automate configs, brainstorm product ideas, or just make your day a little easier.\n* Can show us your favorite agile moves\u2014whether you\u2019re a longtime fan of scrum, kanban, shape\\-up, or something you invented to help teams move a little faster, smarter, and happier.\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far and think, \u201cHey, that sounds a bit like me!\u201d (even if you don\u2019t check every single box), don\u2019t be shy, say hello! We\u2019re a team that\u2019s serious about our craft but not about ourselves. If you\u2019re passionate, curious, and ready to join a group that works hard, laughs often, and genuinely enjoys building cool things together, we can\u2019t wait to meet you.\n\n **Disclaimer**\n\n  \n\nSoundstripe is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce.

      "description": "The Revi Mission\nBrick and mortar is not dead but drastically changing, and Revi is leading that change into the future. 31 years ago, Web 1\\.0 started and it gave people the ability to click hyperlinks and read text. When Web 2\\.0 came about 10 years later, it revolutionized the world. It allowed people to do things like buy, ship, mail, shop, and more.  \n\nIn the past, doing these things was only reserved for an in\\-person physical experience, but they can now be done online. That one technological advancement, though simple, changed the world. Now, the internet is so robust that there are things you can do online that you can not do in a physical location. This is the next great shift in the market that Revi is calling Web 3\\.0\\.  \n\nCompanies are now trying to bring this digital experience into physical stores in their own siloed ecosystems. For example, Uber brings a simplified way to interact with cabs in the physical world, Bonobos brings a simplified way to interact with their physical retail stores, and the Amazon Go store simplifies purchasing in its physical stores. Revi is looking to bring this way of interacting with physical locations to all consumers, no matter what physical store you walk into.  \n\nRevi offers businesses an in\\-store digital platform that allows businesses to build long\\-lasting relationships with their customers and allows consumers to interact with any business they walk into digitally. Our product is a beautifully designed in\\-store self\\-ordering system where consumers can buy, pay, get rewards, and much more. The data collected is leveraged to improve the ordering experience and attract new consumers. With a fresh round of Series A funding from top Silicon Valley seed investors, we are ready to pursue a multi\\-billion dollar opportunity.  \n\nIt's an excellent time to join because\nYou'll be stepping into a mission\\-critical role that directly supports Revi\u2019s path to IPO.

We run three such communities today, including our flagship TechGC, which is a private, invite\\-only community for General Counsels \\& CLOs of high\\-growth tech companies and venture funds. We also run DeputyGC (for Deputy GCs \\& Associate GCs) and The F Suite (for CFOs), with more to come.\n\n\nWe currently have 4,500\\+ paid members across our communities, representing C\\-Suite executives from many of today\u2019s leading tech companies (e.g., Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Uber, Notion, Bolt, Figma, Airtable, Dropbox, etc.) and venture funds (e.g., a16z, Softbank, Tiger, Accel, Thrive, Battery Ventures, FirstMark, etc.). We also have deep partnerships with the top law firms, professional service providers, and technology vendors supporting these executives.\n\n\nEach of our communities is unique, but they are all centered around the same guiding principle \\- to help leaders succeed in their careers by connecting them with their closest peers and advisors for highly curated and targeted education, mentorship, and support. We do this through a combination of events, 1\\-on\\-1 and small group matches, and a custom\\-built tech platform which our members like to call \u201cthe Braintrust.\u201d\n\n\nWe are a well\\-funded, profitable, and rapidly scaling startup with a high\\-impact team of 45\\+.\n\n**What Makes Us Unique**\n\n\nWe fill a painful hole in the market at an unprecedented time in history. As professionals struggle to navigate an increasingly complex business environment, the right information and perspective has become harder and harder to find. The dominant networking platforms of the day are too broad and diluted to be effective resources, and it has become difficult to parse through the noise and misinformation to hone in on what really matters. Professionals are rapidly retreating back to private, trusted communities for their information, support, and their most interesting conversations.\n\n\nThat\u2019s where we come in. We connect professionals to their most valuable resource \\- their peers \\- through a highly\\-curated collection of professional communities. We run hundreds of educational and networking events for our members throughout the year, each of which is focused on specific issues and practical advice to help them navigate their most pressing challenges. Our members also get access to the Braintrust, which provides personalized learning and research capabilities. The content library includes hundreds of instructional videos, tactical learning materials, and peer\\-vetted forms.\n\n**Ready to join us?** Fill out an application below.\n\n\nCompensation Range: $180K \\- $200K",

      "description": "**Why Standard Fleet?**\n=======================\n\n\nConnected vehicles are transforming fleet operations across industries, led by the electric revolution. EVs were the first truly software\\-defined vehicles, and businesses are rapidly adopting them but lack the software infrastructure to unlock their true value.\n\n\nOur mission is to build the fleet management platform for the electric vehicle era \\- becoming the default software layer that empowers fleet operators to maximize efficiency and profitability without hardware modifications.\n\n\nEvery member of the Standard Fleet team is fueled by an unwavering passion for revolutionizing mobility through software and is deeply committed to making our products better. We come from companies like Apple, Uber, Tesla, Stripe, Robinhood, and Yelp and were the first to officially integrate with Tesla's fleet API. We've achieved 5\\.7x growth in 2024 with a small team and want your help to accelerate further.\n\n\nStandard Fleet is well\\-funded and backed by some of Silicon Valley's top investors. We were founded by David Hodge, who previously founded Embark. At Embark, the team built a popular transportation app used by millions, which was eventually sold to Apple.\n\n**Role Overview**\n=================\n\n\nWe are seeking a Market Development Manager to pioneer our expansion into enterprise fleet operations. Reporting directly to our CEO, you'll build our enterprise go\\-to\\-market strategy from the ground up, targeting major rental companies, corporations, insurance providers, government fleets, and financial institutions.\n\n\nThis is NOT a traditional sales role \\- it's an opportunity to be the architect of our enterprise motion. You'll combine deep market research with hands\\-on execution to understand how the largest fleet operators make decisions, identify entry points, and craft targeted approaches that showcase our platform's value. From mapping complex org charts to structuring strategic pilots, you'll own the entire enterprise development process while working closely with our CEO to crack the enterprise code.\n\n\nThis role is perfect for someone with a founder mindset who has seen successful enterprise go\\-to\\-market at another startup and wants to build that motion from scratch. We need a patient builder, not someone looking to inherit a playbook or immediately scale a sales team. If you're analytical, resourceful, and excited about figuring out what it takes to win in enterprise, we want to hear from you.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n====================\n\n* Research and prioritize enterprise targets across key verticals (rental, corporate, insurance, government, financial), developing deep insights into their organizational structures and decision\\-making processes\n* Design and execute tailored go\\-to\\-market strategies for each account type, identifying optimal entry points and value propositions that resonate with enterprise buyers\n* Build and nurture relationships with enterprise prospects through strategic outreach, conferences, and networking to establish Standard Fleet as a trusted partner\n* Structure and manage strategic pilots that demonstrate clear ROI, ensuring successful outcomes that lead to expanded deployments\n* Partner cross\\-functionally with CEO, BizOps, Product, and Engineering to align enterprise requirements with company strategy and ensure smooth implementations\n\n**Qualifications**\n==================\n\n\nWe don\u2019t believe in qualification checkboxes for candidates. These often cause great candidates to think they\u2019re not qualified. If you think you can help us scale our business, let\u2019s talk and see if we\u2019re a fit.\n\n**You might be a good fit if...**\n=================================\n\n* You have 2\\-6 years of experience in GTM, revenue operations, or sales at a fast\\-growing startup that targeted enterprise customers\n* You're a strategic thinker who also loves rolling up your sleeves to execute\n* You have exceptional research and analytical skills with the ability to synthesize complex information into actionable insights\n* You're resourceful and creative in finding ways to connect with hard\\-to\\-reach executives\n* You understand enterprise sales cycles and can navigate complex organizational dynamics with patience and persistence\n* You're excited about building something from scratch rather than inheriting an existing playbook\n* You have strong presentation skills and can confidently engage with C\\-level executives\n* You're comfortable with ambiguity and can create structure where none exists\n* You're passionate about electric vehicles and the future of transportation\n* You have high standards and a strong work ethic \\- you always bring your best and expect your colleagues to do the same\n\n**Benefits**\n============\n\n\n Competitive salary \\& equity  \n\n Top notch health, dental, \\& vision insurance  \n\n 401(k) retirement plan  \n\n All equipment provided by Standard Fleet  \n\nFirst EV purchase subsidy\n\n**Location**\n============\n\n\nThis role based out of San Francisco, CA. Our office is located near the Giant's stadium and is dog\\-friendly.",

All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U. S. For certain classes of temporary visas, the resulting work authorization may be specific to Click Therapeutics and the specific job and/or work site. Click Therapeutics may at its business discretion decide to or refrain from obtaining, maintaining and/or extending the temporary visa status and/or sponsoring a colleague for permanent residency and /or employment eligibility, considering factors such as availability of qualified U.S. workers and the colleague's long\\-term prospects for securing lawful permanent residence, among other reasons. Employment applicants requiring immigration sponsorship must disclose, when initial application for employment is made, whether or not they are legally authorized to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. and, if so, whether that authorization permits them to work in the job they seek. In no case should Click Therapeutics support of a colleague's temporary visa application or sponsorship of a colleague for permanent residence be construed to guarantee success of that application or amend or otherwise invalidate the \"at\\-will\" employment relationship between the colleague and Click Therapeutics.\n\n\n**Recruitment Phishing Scams:**\n\n\n\nFake job advertisements and offers are increasingly appearing on the internet. If you have encountered a job posting or have been approached with a job offer that you suspect may be fraudulent, we strongly recommend you do not respond and report it to the Federal Trade Commission and the FBI at https://www.ic3\\.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice.\n\n\n\nPlease be mindful of the following:\n\n\n* Click Therapeutics will only reach out to you through an \"@clicktherapeutics.com\" email address.\n* Other than your email address or telephone number, which you may provide via a job application portal, Click Therapeutics will never ask you to provide personally identifiable information about yourself (such as a Social Security Number or Driver's License Number) via a messaging application (like that used on the LinkedIn platform or Microsoft Teams).\n* Click Therapeutics will conduct interviews face\\-to\\-face over Zoom.\n* All job postings will be listed on the Click Therapeutics official career page.",

Code Search helps devs explore and understand massive codebases. Amp, our agentic coding tool, dramatically accelerates the time it takes to write new code and tackle complex problems like migrating and transforming code.\n\n\n\nWe're trusted by engineering teams at leading companies like Stripe, Uber, and Palo Alto Networks, and with $225M in funding from investors like a16z, Sequoia, and Redpoint, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development. We're a globally distributed team with a culture of high agency, direct communication, and deep love for developers.\n\n\n\nIf you want to work at the bleeding edge of software and do the most meaningful work of your career, join us.\n\n**Location**\n------------\n\n\n\n While we hire almost anywhere in the world, we have a strong preference for someone to reside in the following locations for this role. However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with PST for at least 30 hours/week.\n\n\n**Preferred locations:**\n\n\n* San Francisco, CA\n* Denver, CO\n\n  \n\n\n**Why this job is exciting**\n----------------------------\n\n\n\nAs a Product Marketing Manager at Sourcegraph, you will become an expert in one of the hottest current market opportunities: generative AI for developer tools. This is a competitive space, and Product Marketing's role to define our product narrative and deliver crisp content is critical to our success. If you're interested in working in the intersection of generative AI, dev tools, and Marketing (messaging, storytelling, and sales enablement), then this role is for you.\n\n\n\nIn this role, you'll work collaboratively with Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Sales teams.You will be a key content creator with an emphasis on all things technical. You will be a key content creator within the Marketing team and focus deeply on individual devs and our enterprise customers. You will create technical blogs, whitepapers, reports, and slide decks for marketing and sales support. You will also craft demo flows, talk tracks, and live content that highlight our product's strengths and lean into trends and use cases for devs and generative AI.\n\n\n\nYou will help us tell more stories about how customers use our products and own analyst relations for Sourcegraph. You'll establish a tight feedback loop between Sales, Product, and Marketing. Your understanding of our products and the feedback of our customers will inform our marketing strategy and the content we create in the generative AI space.\n\n\n\nWhile we're a small company and ownership and priorities change often, these are the main areas you'll be responsible for:\n\n\n* Technical product content (videos \\& written content)\n* Product\\-specific support:\n* + Bi\\-weekly \\& monthly release GTM\n\t+ Cody\n\t+ Amp (shared)\n* Lead analyst relations\n* Support customer marketing\n* Product\\-led growth (shared)\n* Content \\& thought leadership (shared)\n\n\nThis role has lots of potential to deepen our company's understanding of generative AI and our brand in the space. This person will be strategic in how they help build our product narrative. This role will also be tactical, and we will look to this PMM to help us move quickly and create content to help grow developers' love for and awareness of Cody every week, particularly among the enterprise segment.\n\n\n\n Within one month, you will\u2026\n\n\n* Become an expert on our product, including its strengths and limitations.\n* Take over analyst relations, maintaining relationships with industry experts across top firms.\n* Begin researching new use cases for AI in the developer ecosystem, including through customer calls, to bring new insights back to the Marketing team.\n\n\n Within three months, you will\u2026\n\n\n* Regularly join customer calls and calls with the Sales team.\n* Report learnings and insights back to the Marketing team in weekly team check\\-ins.\n* Publish several deeply technical blog posts that unpack use cases and best practices for using generative AI for code.\n* Support our Product team with key launch moments.\n* Contribute to the website (sourcegraph.com), and work with the rest of the Product Marketing team to build out new webpages using your learnings on product use cases.\n\n\n Within six months, you will\u2026\n\n\n* Build out content for, and present in, webinars for our prospects.\n* Deliver best practices resources to the Sales and Customer Engineering teams. For example, this could be a whitepaper outlining where and when Cody or Amp is best used for different languages and common development tasks (such as code modernization or unit testing).\n\n\n Within one year, you will\u2026\n\n\n* Establish a formal feedback loop process between Sales, Marketing, and Product teams.\n* Consistently deliver high\\-quality technical content materials that delight developers and speak to an enterprise audience.\n* Create and maintain a demo flow and talk track for Cody that is commonly used by sellers in the field and marketers at trade shows.\n\n  \n\n\n**About you**\n-------------\n\n\n\nYou have a technical background and a passion for working with customers and understanding the go\\-to\\-market strategy side of a business.

You're a natural storyteller with strong communication skills and an interest in B2B technology or dev tools.\n\n\n\nMust haves:\n\n\n* You enjoy writing and consider yourself a strong writer. Much of the work of product marketers involves communicating ideas effectively in writing, so this skill is critical to the PMM role.\n* You have some experience with code and building apps. You use AI coding assistants yourself and know the landscape and have your favorites. This could be writing code professionally, or familiarity through schoolwork or as a hobby. Our products are all about making developers' lives easier as they write code, so a basic understanding of code will be critical to your product expertise and empathy for developers.\n* You're excited about a high\\-agency role. A lot of this role will be work that is done for the first time (for example, interviewing customers and sellers to compile research on new use cases for generative AI). There is *lots* of room for high\\-agency, strategic thinking, and creative approaches in this role.\n* You've worked in an environment with a product\\-led growth model.\n* You're ready to roll up your sleeves and do both strategic and tactical work.

In recent years, we\u2019ve grown into a travel fintech provider, commerce platform, and global travel agency that powers some of the world\u2019s largest brands.\n\n\nThrough HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners\u2019 direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\\-to\\-end travel portals.

As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders.

All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U.
