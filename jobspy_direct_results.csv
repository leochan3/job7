ChowNow is one of the leading players in off\-premise restaurant technology.

Overview





Our mission


The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard\-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

 **We're changing that.** AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way — offering them world\-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. **Our customers enable our modern economy —** ***they deserve it*****.**

  

Our history and background


Our founding team has backgrounds in payments, working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, and building apps that were featured on the Apple app store. We have staff and senior engineers from Google, Uber, Meta, Shopify, Stripe, Chime, and other leading technology companies.

  

We have raised $125 million\+ from investors such as General Catalyst, Elad Gil, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, XYZ; founders and CEOs of companies such as Google (Eric Schmidt), Salesforce (Marc Benioff), Coinbase (Brian Armstrong), DoorDash (Tony Xu), Instacart, Gusto; strategic investors like Mastercard, Flexport and Samsara.

  

We were named to Forbes annual Next Billion\-Dollar Startup List, and have just recently been selected to join the World Economic Forum as a Global Innovator.

  

Our BizOps team handles a variety of problem\-solving challenges. Expect to own a particular area of our business, collaborate with teammates across Engineering, Sales, and Customer Success, and leverage your analytical toolkit on a daily basis. The particular problem you'll work on when you join depends on both business needs \+ your particular strengths and interests. This is a great generalist role to get exposure to all elements of building a high\-growth company \- from on\-the\-ground operations to big\-picture strategy.

 **In this role you might work on:**

* Determining vertical\-specific KPIs
* Optimizing our growth funnel, pre\-and post\-sales
* Building a process playbook for our sales, underwriting, or support teams
* Running experiments to increase our growth or revenue
* Analyzing purchase or payments data and using the results to make business decisions
* Conducting interviews with customers to inform product decisions (and then working with the engineering team to implement)

**What we're looking for:**

* 1\-3 years of experience in management consulting, strategy, at a high\-growth startup, or in a heavily analytical role is a plus
* We are open to different experience levels for this role; your exact responsibilities and scope will match the experience you bring to the table
* Proficiency in data analysis (SQL, Python, or R); you don't need to know SQL when you join, but expect to learn quickly!

**Offer Details:**

* Hybrid role in either New York or San Francisco
* Competitive salary commensurate with experience
* Great benefits and 401(k) match

Overview





Our mission


The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard\-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

 **We're changing that.** AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way — offering them world\-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. **Our customers enable our modern economy —** ***they deserve it*****.**

  

Our history and background


Our founding team has backgrounds in payments, working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, and building apps that were featured on the Apple app store. We have staff and senior engineers from Google, Uber, Meta, Shopify, Stripe, Chime, and other leading technology companies.

  

We have raised $125 million\+ from investors such as General Catalyst, Elad Gil, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, XYZ; founders and CEOs of companies such as Google (Eric Schmidt), Salesforce (Marc Benioff), Coinbase (Brian Armstrong), DoorDash (Tony Xu), Instacart, Gusto; strategic investors like Mastercard, Flexport and Samsara.

  

We were named to Forbes annual Next Billion\-Dollar Startup List, and have just recently been selected to join the World Economic Forum as a Global Innovator.

We’ve created a large marketplace of carriers and businesses that engage with each other to ship LTL\-style freight using FTL vehicles \- also known as partial truckload shipping.

We’re looking for the **absolute best FTL carrier brokers and FTL relationship managers** — people who’ve spent time at brokerages, 3PLs or company departments that source and develop carrier relationships — to help us scale our national carrier base and lock in recurring lanes. If you live and breathe freight and love building relationships with owner\-operators and fleets, we want to talk.

What You'll Do

* Source and onboard qualified FTL and partial carriers into Oway’s network using our in\-house software tools — especially for high\-volume lanes like CA → TX, CA → FL, CA → WA, CA → IL, backhauls and more.
* Manage relationships with fleets ranging from 30 to 1000\+ vehicles.
* Help expand our **dynamic freight pool**by matching carriers with algorithmically optimized loads and bundling opportunities, and make partial freight more accessible for carriers.
* Educate carriers on our **app\-based onboarding**, **automated load offering, digital BOL/POD**, and **automated payments** systems.
* Act as a partner to operations, sales, and product as we refine our nationwide carrier network.

What We're Looking For

* **3\+ years** at a freight brokerage or 3PL in a carrier\-facing role (e.g. Carrier Sales Rep, Capacity Rep, Truckload Procurement)
* Have experience with a clear funnel of onboarding carriers and intuitively working around individual humps and roadblocks without needing heavy guidance.
* Deep understanding of FTL/partial load dynamics, especially working with med\-sized fleets (not owner operators).
* Strong negotiation and communication skills; able to keep carriers loyal with recurring freight.
* Knows how to get carriers moving with **quick pay, factoring**, and incentive strategies.
* Bonus if you’ve worked with **ELD integrations**, **load boards**, or **routing platforms.**

* Showcase the team's work clearly and credibly to influence cross\-functional decision\-making and leadership alignment.
* Drive concurrent execution of multiple experience initiatives, each with their own cross\-functional dependencies and success metrics.
* Partner with product, design, operations, and mobility platform teams to define strategy, roadmap, and north\-star UX for AV and future\-facing trip experiences.
* Define and ship new product paradigms that enhance rider trust, reduce friction, and improve conversion rates across the trip funnel.
* Lead large\-scale, cross\-functional programs and effectively represent the team's work in executive settings\-showcasing progress, shaping priorities, and surfacing tradeoffs with influence and clarity.
* Coach and mentor engineers and technical leads, fostering a culture of ownership, creativity, and high execution velocity.

**Basic Qualifications**
* Bachelor's (or higher) degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field.
* 2\+ years of engineering management experience with demonstrated success managing cross\-surface or platform teams.
* Track record of building user\-centric products with a strong grasp of usability, quality, and iteration.
* Strong planning and organizational skills, especially in managing parallel, high\-impact initiatives.
* Data\-driven mindset with the ability to define KPIs and optimize user flows via experimentation and analysis.

**Preferred Qualifications**
* 8\+ years of industry experience building large\-scale consumer\-facing software systems.
* Experience building adaptable UX across diverse environments (e.g., mobile, form\-factor\-specific Android surfaces, or contextual apps).
* Understanding of marketplace dynamics (e.g., matching, dispatch, routing), with experience building for or integrating with ML/OR\-based optimization systems.
* Proven ability to lead complex, multi\-quarter programs with broad cross\-functional alignment and visibility.
* Comfort working in fast\-moving, ambiguous product spaces that require abstraction and scaling across diverse platforms or partners.
* Experience engaging with executive stakeholders and representing strategy and execution at the leadership level.
* Background in transportation, logistics, trust \& safety, or other domains requiring high\-reliability user experience.
Platform thinking: designing systems that enable surface reuse, customization, and scalability across varied environments.

 **The Opportunity**

  

We're seeking an Engineering Manager with deep experience across infrastructure, devops, cloud, and application development to join our fully remote team. While your primary focus will be on building, securing, and operating the robust systems that power Soundstripe, you’ll also be hands\-on in application development, collaborating across all corners of our product suite.

  

In this fluid and highly collaborative environment, you’ll guide a versatile team responsible for everything from the security and scalability of our core infrastructure, to delivering new features and improvements in our Rails web application, public API for enterprise customers, React Native mobile app, and creative extensions—like our Adobe Premiere tools and Twitch integration. You’ll work side\-by\-side with Product and Design, adapting to shifting priorities, and ensuring we deliver secure, reliable, and innovative solutions for all our users. If you’re a proactive, adaptable leader who thrives on variety, drives accountability, and values strong engineering culture in a distributed setting, we’d love to meet you.

  

How you’ll make an impact:

  

* Champion both the big picture and the small details—leading and supporting a team of engineers building and maintaining the vital infrastructure behind our products and services.
* Dig into code, config, and best practices when needed. You’re comfortable moving between architecting the next system, reviewing a pull request, and jumping into an incident call.
* Guide your team through technical challenges; whether it’s deploying a new cloud service, scaling our databases, or tightening security.
* Lead effective, high\-trust project planning, milestone delivery, and sprint execution, always looking for ways to make work smoother and more reliable.
* Be the guardian of operational excellence: implement, monitor, and continually improve our infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and security posture.
* Own our security practices. You’ll oversee everything from incident response to security audits, and help create a culture where everyone knows how to keep our apps and data safe.
* Inspire your team to grow: coach, mentor, perform reviews, and foster an environment of curiosity, learning, and honest feedback.
* Collaborate deeply with Product and Design, partnering on everything from feature planning to launch, and ensuring engineering’s voice is heard in every conversation.
* Contribute ideas, process improvements, technical guidance, and your unique energy in a fully remote, distributed environment.

  


**Who Will Love This Job**

  

A systems thinker and a fixer. You see the whole playing field. You get a kick out of connecting dots and jumping into thorny problems; be it a tricky SQL query, a critical incident, or a cross\-team product launch.

  

A curious innovator. You never settle for “that’s how we’ve always done it.” You actively look for ways to improve performance, security, and workflow for everyone on your team.

  

A devops\-minded leader. You are as comfortable talking about Rails best practices as you are discussing firewalls, cloud service orchestration, or load balancer configs.

  

A clear, open communicator. You can break down technical concepts for non\-engineers and facilitate honest, constructive conversations in a remote team.

  

A coach at heart. You’re excited to see others grow, and you love making your team feel seen, supported, and challenged.

  

A calm operator. When infrastructure quirks or security alerts threaten to throw a wrench in things, you keep your cool and inspire the same steady focus in others.

  

A culture champion. You lead with empathy, humility, and optimism. You genuinely care about the mission, the quality of our work, and the people you work with.

  

A passion for our stack. Deep Rails experience is a must; if you love working up and down the stack, even better.

  

And of course, you value what we value:


* Provide all customers with genuine and whimsical care.
* Confront harsh realities with optimism.
* Keep it light.
* Learn \& grow.
* Clear communication is kind.
* Make it better.
* Date the model, marry the mission.
* Be humble.
* Quality over quantity.
* Done is better than perfect.

  


**What to Expect**

  

As an Engineering Manager focused on infrastructure, security, compliance, and application development, you’ll help guide key areas that keep Soundstripe’s products running safely and smoothly. You’ll be joining a high\-performing, good\-natured, and adaptable team that values collaboration and works closely with Product, Design, and stakeholders from all parts of the company. We take our work seriously but keep the atmosphere light, celebrating wins (big and small), sharing the occasional meme, and always supporting each other along the way.



Soundstripe is a remote\-first company with a geographically distributed team. We collaborate daily using Slack, Zoom, and GitHub, which helps us stay connected and productive no matter which time zone we are in. Although there are a few chances for in\-person meetups each year, most of our work and teamwork happens virtually, and everyone is valued as an important part of the team.

 **What You Bring**

  

* Chances are, you’ve seen your share of launch celebrations and production fire drills—maybe that’s about a decade’s worth of hands\-on experience designing, building, and supporting real\-world web applications and the infrastructure behind them.
* Ruby on Rails? You not only speak its language, you think in it. (We do too; it’s the heart of our stack.) Sure, you probably have some other languages under your belt, but you’re happiest when Rails is home base.
* You’re no stranger to the essentials: Git, GitHub, and version control best practices are second nature to you. If you’ve ever rescued a teammate from a gnarly merge conflict, you’ll fit right in.
* You love working with APIs; integrating with third parties, revamping our endpoints, documenting for partners, and making sure our own Soundstripe API keeps purring for enterprise customers.
* Cloud\-native? Absolutely. You’ve spun up servers on Ubuntu (or cousins), wrangled databases (Postgres fans, take a bow), tinkered with GitHub Actions, and kept deployments running smoothly. Bonus points if you smile at the words “load balancer” or “server tuning.”
* Network devices don’t scare you. If anything, you’ve configured your share of firewalls, routers, switches, or caught a bug hiding in a DNS record.
* You have a “safety first” reflex. Whether it’s responding to security incidents or nudging a teammate to enable 2FA, you take security seriously, but you know how to make it approachable for your team.
* Working with product managers, designers, and everyone who cares about our users is something you enjoy. You see the big picture and help connect the dots across disciplines.
* Remote work isn’t new to you. Whether you’re in your home office, a coffee shop, or halfway across the country from your team, you know how to communicate, collaborate, and keep projects humming along.
* And finally, you know your way around modern cloud environments—whether it’s DigitalOcean, AWS, Cloud66, or Fastly, you’re comfortable building and operating production systems on these platforms, and you aren’t fazed by the rapidly changing toolchain and migrations.

  



If any of this resonates with you, we’d love to hear from you! Even more so if you also:

  

* Have dipped your toes (or dived in headfirst) into operating in PCI or GDPR\-compliant environments and know what it takes to keep things safe and auditable for everyone.
* Are already teaming up with Large Language Models or AI agents. Maybe you’re using them to write and review code, whip up documentation, supercharge testing, automate configs, brainstorm product ideas, or just make your day a little easier.
* Can show us your favorite agile moves—whether you’re a longtime fan of scrum, kanban, shape\-up, or something you invented to help teams move a little faster, smarter, and happier.

  



If you’ve made it this far and think, “Hey, that sounds a bit like me!” (even if you don’t check every single box), don’t be shy, say hello! We’re a team that’s serious about our craft but not about ourselves. If you’re passionate, curious, and ready to join a group that works hard, laughs often, and genuinely enjoys building cool things together, we can’t wait to meet you.

Brick and mortar is not dead but drastically changing, and Revi is leading that change into the future. 31 years ago, Web 1\.0 started and it gave people the ability to click hyperlinks and read text. When Web 2\.0 came about 10 years later, it revolutionized the world. It allowed people to do things like buy, ship, mail, shop, and more.  

In the past, doing these things was only reserved for an in\-person physical experience, but they can now be done online. That one technological advancement, though simple, changed the world. Now, the internet is so robust that there are things you can do online that you can not do in a physical location. This is the next great shift in the market that Revi is calling Web 3\.0\.  

Companies are now trying to bring this digital experience into physical stores in their own siloed ecosystems. For example, Uber brings a simplified way to interact with cabs in the physical world, Bonobos brings a simplified way to interact with their physical retail stores, and the Amazon Go store simplifies purchasing in its physical stores. Revi is looking to bring this way of interacting with physical locations to all consumers, no matter what physical store you walk into.  

Revi offers businesses an in\-store digital platform that allows businesses to build long\-lasting relationships with their customers and allows consumers to interact with any business they walk into digitally. Our product is a beautifully designed in\-store self\-ordering system where consumers can buy, pay, get rewards, and much more. The data collected is leveraged to improve the ordering experience and attract new consumers. With a fresh round of Series A funding from top Silicon Valley seed investors, we are ready to pursue a multi\-billion dollar opportunity.

About the Role


We are seeking a Senior Product Designer to join our Growth team with a dual focus: building a unified sales platform and supporting our broader internal operations tools. This role spans two key initiatives that will transform how Ramp's teams operate internally.

**Sales Platform Focus:** You'll lead design for a cohesive ecosystem that consolidates existing sales tools (Toki, CDP, Kayo) to streamline both pre\-sales and post\-sales functions. This platform will create shared, reusable functionality like recommendations and alerting systems that benefit multiple teams.


As the design lead for the sales platform, you'll create elegant and efficient experiences for Account Managers, SDRs, AEs, and CSRs. Working across multiple teams, you'll need strong system\-thinking abilities to connect disparate workflows into a unified, intuitive platform. Your work will directly impact Ramp's sales effectiveness by enhancing productivity across the entire sales funnel.


We're initially focusing on solutions for Sales Development (Toki) and Account Management/Customer Success (Kayo) teams, with plans to expand to support Account Executives, Channel Partner Managers, and marketing teams.

**Internal Operations Focus:** Beyond sales tools, you'll support our internal operations team through an emerging design effort. This requires deep involvement in early discovery to understand how design can best support teams across CX, Risk, Growth, Post\-Sales, and beyond.


You'll conduct thorough internal research and need\-finding across various teams to determine how we can transform our current ecosystem of over 1,000 applications into a manageable number of tools that operators love to use.

We’re looking for a **Vice President of Sales** to help lead ChowNow through its next phase of growth—someone who knows that the core of this role is enabling sales teams to thrive while driving sustainable, scalable revenue.  

If you’re a compelling communicator who can galvanize teams, inspire action, and turn strategy into execution, we want to hear from you. **ABOUT US:**  

ChowNow is one of the leading players in off\-premise restaurant technology. As takeout becomes a vital revenue stream for independent restaurants, our platform helps owners focus on what they do best—serving great food—by offering solutions across the entire digital dining experience.

We support over **20,000 restaurants across North America**, helping process **$1B\+ in gross food sales** while saving our partners over **$700M in third\-party commission fees**. Through our white\-label ordering solutions, a growing demand network (including Google, Yelp, Apple, and Snap), and a diner\-friendly marketplace, we empower independent restaurants to own their customer relationships and avoid inflated pricing and fees charged by 3rd party delivery apps like Uber and Doordash.  

Founded in 2012, we’ve navigated rapid growth and transformation—from startup roots through the pandemic boom—and are now beginning an exciting new era under our CEO, **Kanika Soni**. As we evolve with new leadership and cutting\-edge tools, we’re deepening our commitment to helping local restaurants thrive in the digital economy. **About the Position:**  

As our Vice President of Sales, you’ll lead our B2B direct sales organization and be a key member of the leadership team shaping our high\-growth strategy. You’ll work cross\-functionally with marketing, client services, and product teams to align efforts and drive results.

**About The Suite**


We build high\-quality and highly\-curated professional communities. We run three such communities today, including our flagship TechGC, which is a private, invite\-only community for General Counsels \& CLOs of high\-growth tech companies and venture funds. We also run DeputyGC (for Deputy GCs \& Associate GCs) and The F Suite (for CFOs), with more to come.


We currently have 4,500\+ paid members across our communities, representing C\-Suite executives from many of today’s leading tech companies (e.g., Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, Uber, Notion, Bolt, Figma, Airtable, Dropbox, etc.) and venture funds (e.g., a16z, Softbank, Tiger, Accel, Thrive, Battery Ventures, FirstMark, etc.). We also have deep partnerships with the top law firms, professional service providers, and technology vendors supporting these executives.


Each of our communities is unique, but they are all centered around the same guiding principle \- to help leaders succeed in their careers by connecting them with their closest peers and advisors for highly curated and targeted education, mentorship, and support. We do this through a combination of events, 1\-on\-1 and small group matches, and a custom\-built tech platform which our members like to call “the Braintrust.”


We are a well\-funded, profitable, and rapidly scaling startup with a high\-impact team of 45\+.

**What Makes Us Unique**


We fill a painful hole in the market at an unprecedented time in history. As professionals struggle to navigate an increasingly complex business environment, the right information and perspective has become harder and harder to find. The dominant networking platforms of the day are too broad and diluted to be effective resources, and it has become difficult to parse through the noise and misinformation to hone in on what really matters. Professionals are rapidly retreating back to private, trusted communities for their information, support, and their most interesting conversations.


That’s where we come in. We connect professionals to their most valuable resource \- their peers \- through a highly\-curated collection of professional communities. We run hundreds of educational and networking events for our members throughout the year, each of which is focused on specific issues and practical advice to help them navigate their most pressing challenges. Our members also get access to the Braintrust, which provides personalized learning and research capabilities. The content library includes hundreds of instructional videos, tactical learning materials, and peer\-vetted forms.

As a Product Manager on the Uber Grocery \& Retail Restricted Items team, you'll play a key role in achieving our mission of unlocking the biggest selection and delivering the best\-in\-class shopping experience for our restricted item categories, empowering our customers, delivery partners, and merchants to seamlessly, safely and compliantly purchase, deliver, and sell these products on the Eats Marketplace. On UberEats, Restricted Items consist of Alcohol, Over\-the\-counter medications, Prescriptions, Tobacco and Cannabis items in eligible markets, and we are continuously looking to extend our selection coverage and pursue new categories while at the same time being socially responsible about how we sell these items to the public.
  

  

In this role, you will drive the strategy, roadmap, and thought leadership behind features that will scalably unlock new restricted item categories in new markets, strengthen our reliability and compliance in markets we're already launched in, and accelerate growth of these burgeoning categories. You will own the end\-to\-end success of these categories, from optimizing how customers search and discover restricted items amongst a myriad of restrictions, to ensuring seamless and compliant deliveries through the Earner flow, to enhancing how merchants merchandise and promote these products in their storefronts. The Restricted Items team sits within the Grocery \& Retail organization, a rapidly growing category on Eats with significant conviction and investment.
  

  

You will be driving projects with a broad set of cross\-functional stakeholders across engineering, design, business development, sales, operations, data science, legal, privacy, and more. This role is a great fit for a PM with a real passion for solving complex problems across global markets, great technical depth, principled thinking, seasoned prioritization skills, and a mentality of starting with the customer first and working backward. This PM will be most successful if they are excited about becoming completely immersed in the Restricted Items world \- you will ultimately be the subject matter expert when it comes to third party delivery of regulated items.
  

  

**What the Candidate Will Do**  

  

The opportunities to advance the restricted items charter are endless. This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling on the team:
  

* Drive the strategy, roadmap, and thought leadership behind features that will scalably unlock new restricted item categories in new markets, strengthen our reliability in markets we're already launched in, and accelerate growth of these burgeoning categories
* Craft the foundations required to effectively unlock new restricted item business lines, driving incremental revenue in new markets we're currently blocked in due to lack of product support for local regulations (ie. Cannabis in the US, Pharmacy in the UK)
* Optimize how we surface restricted items in the customer shopping journey \- through search, browse, promotions, and merchandising \- how can we maximize the discoverability and orderability of restricted items while still being socially responsible and adhering to regional regulations?
* Collaborate closely with regional operations and business partners in order to understand the local regulations and pain points related to restricted items, then synthesize the feedback across global markets to develop a strategic product roadmap to solve them
* Ideate on and implement innovative and effective ways to strengthen age verification flows to deter minor delivery and discourage Earner non\-compliant behaviors, improving our global compliance rates
* Ensure the end\-to\-end reliability and success of trips that contain restricted items
* Optimize how merchants onboard and configure their catalogs for restricted items, maximizing the orderability and selection of these products
Influence and collaborate with various product teams across Uber that we depend on in order to ensure compliant deliveries of restricted items (ie. Search, Earner Experience, Fulfillment)  
* 

  

  

**Basic Qualifications**  

  

* Minimum 3\-5 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them
Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands\-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the meta  
* 

  

  

**Preferred Qualifications**  

  

* Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process
* Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner's problems
* Finger\-tippiness with data. You find a way to get the data you need and whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage this data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis
* A Driver"" mindset. You are biased toward action, a great collaborator, a master disambiguator/simplifier, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
* Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands\-on
* A high bar across the board \- from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on
* A true passion for Uber's mission, our products, and the company's hybrid technology/operations nature
A never\-ending desire to grow and learn  
*

As a Product Manager on the Uber Grocery \& Retail Restricted Items team, you'll play a key role in achieving our mission of unlocking the biggest selection and delivering the best\-in\-class shopping experience for our restricted item categories, empowering our customers, delivery partners, and merchants to seamlessly, safely and compliantly purchase, deliver, and sell these products on the Eats Marketplace. On UberEats, Restricted Items consist of Alcohol, Over\-the\-counter medications, Prescriptions, Tobacco and Cannabis items in eligible markets, and we are continuously looking to extend our selection coverage and pursue new categories while at the same time being socially responsible about how we sell these items to the public.
  

  

In this role, you will drive the strategy, roadmap, and thought leadership behind features that will scalably unlock new restricted item categories in new markets, strengthen our reliability and compliance in markets we're already launched in, and accelerate growth of these burgeoning categories. You will own the end\-to\-end success of these categories, from optimizing how customers search and discover restricted items amongst a myriad of restrictions, to ensuring seamless and compliant deliveries through the Earner flow, to enhancing how merchants merchandise and promote these products in their storefronts. The Restricted Items team sits within the Grocery \& Retail organization, a rapidly growing category on Eats with significant conviction and investment.
  

  

You will be driving projects with a broad set of cross\-functional stakeholders across engineering, design, business development, sales, operations, data science, legal, privacy, and more. This role is a great fit for a PM with a real passion for solving complex problems across global markets, great technical depth, principled thinking, seasoned prioritization skills, and a mentality of starting with the customer first and working backward.

**What the Candidate Will Do**  

  

The opportunities to advance the restricted items charter are endless. This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling on the team:
  

* Drive the strategy, roadmap, and thought leadership behind features that will scalably unlock new restricted item categories in new markets, strengthen our reliability in markets we're already launched in, and accelerate growth of these burgeoning categories
* Craft the foundations required to effectively unlock new restricted item business lines, driving incremental revenue in new markets we're currently blocked in due to lack of product support for local regulations (ie. Cannabis in the US, Pharmacy in the UK)
* Optimize how we surface restricted items in the customer shopping journey \- through search, browse, promotions, and merchandising \- how can we maximize the discoverability and orderability of restricted items while still being socially responsible and adhering to regional regulations?
* Collaborate closely with regional operations and business partners in order to understand the local regulations and pain points related to restricted items, then synthesize the feedback across global markets to develop a strategic product roadmap to solve them
* Ideate on and implement innovative and effective ways to strengthen age verification flows to deter minor delivery and discourage Earner non\-compliant behaviors, improving our global compliance rates
* Ensure the end\-to\-end reliability and success of trips that contain restricted items
* Optimize how merchants onboard and configure their catalogs for restricted items, maximizing the orderability and selection of these products
Influence and collaborate with various product teams across Uber that we depend on in order to ensure compliant deliveries of restricted items (ie. Search, Earner Experience, Fulfillment)  
* 

  

  

**Basic Qualifications**  

  

* Minimum 3\-5 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them
Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands\-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the meta  
* 

  

  

**Preferred Qualifications**  

  

* Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process
* Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner's problems

* A Driver"" mindset. You are biased toward action, a great collaborator, a master disambiguator/simplifier, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
* Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands\-on
* A high bar across the board \- from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on
* A true passion for Uber's mission, our products, and the company's hybrid technology/operations nature
A never\-ending desire to grow and learn  
*

=======================


Connected vehicles are transforming fleet operations across industries, led by the electric revolution. EVs were the first truly software\-defined vehicles, and businesses are rapidly adopting them but lack the software infrastructure to unlock their true value.


Our mission is to build the fleet management platform for the electric vehicle era \- becoming the default software layer that empowers fleet operators to maximize efficiency and profitability without hardware modifications.


Every member of the Standard Fleet team is fueled by an unwavering passion for revolutionizing mobility through software and is deeply committed to making our products better. We come from companies like Apple, Uber, Tesla, Stripe, Robinhood, and Yelp and were the first to officially integrate with Tesla's fleet API. We've achieved 5\.7x growth in 2024 with a small team and want your help to accelerate further.


Standard Fleet is well\-funded and backed by some of Silicon Valley's top investors. We were founded by David Hodge, who previously founded Embark. At Embark, the team built a popular transportation app used by millions, which was eventually sold to Apple.

**Role Overview**
=================


We are seeking a Market Development Manager to pioneer our expansion into enterprise fleet operations. Reporting directly to our CEO, you'll build our enterprise go\-to\-market strategy from the ground up, targeting major rental companies, corporations, insurance providers, government fleets, and financial institutions.


This is NOT a traditional sales role \- it's an opportunity to be the architect of our enterprise motion. You'll combine deep market research with hands\-on execution to understand how the largest fleet operators make decisions, identify entry points, and craft targeted approaches that showcase our platform's value. From mapping complex org charts to structuring strategic pilots, you'll own the entire enterprise development process while working closely with our CEO to crack the enterprise code.


This role is perfect for someone with a founder mindset who has seen successful enterprise go\-to\-market at another startup and wants to build that motion from scratch. We need a patient builder, not someone looking to inherit a playbook or immediately scale a sales team. If you're analytical, resourceful, and excited about figuring out what it takes to win in enterprise, we want to hear from you.

**Responsibilities**
====================

* Research and prioritize enterprise targets across key verticals (rental, corporate, insurance, government, financial), developing deep insights into their organizational structures and decision\-making processes
* Design and execute tailored go\-to\-market strategies for each account type, identifying optimal entry points and value propositions that resonate with enterprise buyers
* Build and nurture relationships with enterprise prospects through strategic outreach, conferences, and networking to establish Standard Fleet as a trusted partner
* Structure and manage strategic pilots that demonstrate clear ROI, ensuring successful outcomes that lead to expanded deployments
* Partner cross\-functionally with CEO, BizOps, Product, and Engineering to align enterprise requirements with company strategy and ensure smooth implementations

**Qualifications**
==================


We don’t believe in qualification checkboxes for candidates. These often cause great candidates to think they’re not qualified. If you think you can help us scale our business, let’s talk and see if we’re a fit.

**You might be a good fit if...**
=================================

* You have 2\-6 years of experience in GTM, revenue operations, or sales at a fast\-growing startup that targeted enterprise customers
* You're a strategic thinker who also loves rolling up your sleeves to execute
* You have exceptional research and analytical skills with the ability to synthesize complex information into actionable insights
* You're resourceful and creative in finding ways to connect with hard\-to\-reach executives
* You understand enterprise sales cycles and can navigate complex organizational dynamics with patience and persistence
* You're excited about building something from scratch rather than inheriting an existing playbook
* You have strong presentation skills and can confidently engage with C\-level executives
* You're comfortable with ambiguity and can create structure where none exists
* You're passionate about electric vehicles and the future of transportation
* You have high standards and a strong work ethic \- you always bring your best and expect your colleagues to do the same

**Benefits**

 Competitive salary \& equity  

 Top notch health, dental, \& vision insurance  

 401(k) retirement plan

You’ll be embedded within the growth team, sitting across paid, lifecycle, and product\-led growth but your toolkit will be unique: GPTs, Python notebooks, Make/Zapier workflows, APIs, and fast scrappy builds.


This is a high\-leverage, high\-autonomy role for someone who thinks in *distribution, speed, and scale.*

**Why this job is exciting**
----------------------------



As a Product Marketing Manager at Sourcegraph, you will become an expert in one of the hottest current market opportunities: generative AI for developer tools. This is a competitive space, and Product Marketing’s role to define our product narrative and deliver crisp content is critical to our success. If you’re interested in working in the intersection of generative AI, dev tools, and Marketing (messaging, storytelling, and sales enablement), then this role is for you.



In this role, you’ll work collaboratively with Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Sales teams.You will be a key content creator with an emphasis on all things technical. You will be a key content creator within the Marketing team and focus deeply on individual devs and our enterprise customers. You will create technical blogs, whitepapers, reports, and slide decks for marketing and sales support. You will also craft demo flows, talk tracks, and live content that highlight our product’s strengths and lean into trends and use cases for devs and generative AI.



You will help us tell more stories about how customers use our products and own analyst relations for Sourcegraph. You’ll establish a tight feedback loop between Sales, Product, and Marketing. Your understanding of our products and the feedback of our customers will inform our marketing strategy and the content we create in the generative AI space.



While we’re a small company and ownership and priorities change often, these are the main areas you’ll be responsible for:


* Technical product content (videos \& written content)
* Product\-specific support:
* + Bi\-weekly \& monthly release GTM
	+ Cody
	+ Amp (shared)
* Lead analyst relations
* Support customer marketing
* Product\-led growth (shared)
* Content \& thought leadership (shared)


This role has lots of potential to deepen our company’s understanding of generative AI and our brand in the space. This person will be strategic in how they help build our product narrative. This role will also be tactical, and we will look to this PMM to help us move quickly and create content to help grow developers’ love for and awareness of Cody every week, particularly among the enterprise segment.



 Within one month, you will…


* Become an expert on our product, including its strengths and limitations.
* Take over analyst relations, maintaining relationships with industry experts across top firms.
* Begin researching new use cases for AI in the developer ecosystem, including through customer calls, to bring new insights back to the Marketing team.


 Within three months, you will…


* Regularly join customer calls and calls with the Sales team.
* Report learnings and insights back to the Marketing team in weekly team check\-ins.
* Publish several deeply technical blog posts that unpack use cases and best practices for using generative AI for code.
* Support our Product team with key launch moments.
* Contribute to the website (sourcegraph.com), and work with the rest of the Product Marketing team to build out new webpages using your learnings on product use cases.


 Within six months, you will…


* Build out content for, and present in, webinars for our prospects.
* Deliver best practices resources to the Sales and Customer Engineering teams. For example, this could be a whitepaper outlining where and when Cody or Amp is best used for different languages and common development tasks (such as code modernization or unit testing).


 Within one year, you will…


* Establish a formal feedback loop process between Sales, Marketing, and Product teams.
* Consistently deliver high\-quality technical content materials that delight developers and speak to an enterprise audience.
* Create and maintain a demo flow and talk track for Cody that is commonly used by sellers in the field and marketers at trade shows.

  


**About you**
-------------



You have a technical background and a passion for working with customers and understanding the go\-to\-market strategy side of a business. You also have a strong interest in generative AI and its applications and are excited to do research in the area. You’re a natural storyteller with strong communication skills and an interest in B2B technology or dev tools.



Must haves:


* You enjoy writing and consider yourself a strong writer. Much of the work of product marketers involves communicating ideas effectively in writing, so this skill is critical to the PMM role.
* You have some experience with code and building apps. You use AI coding assistants yourself and know the landscape and have your favorites. This could be writing code professionally, or familiarity through schoolwork or as a hobby. Our products are all about making developers’ lives easier as they write code, so a basic understanding of code will be critical to your product expertise and empathy for developers.
* You’re excited about a high\-agency role. A lot of this role will be work that is done for the first time (for example, interviewing customers and sellers to compile research on new use cases for generative AI). There is *lots* of room for high\-agency, strategic thinking, and creative approaches in this role.
* You’ve worked in an environment with a product\-led growth model.
* You’re ready to roll up your sleeves and do both strategic and tactical work. As the PMM in this role, you will do research and help with narrative storytelling, but you’ll spend even more time writing content, getting on calls with customers, and occasionally running webinars. Everyone on Sourcegraph’s marketing team gets hands\-on with building content, all the way up to the CMO!


Nice\-to\-haves:


* You have 5\-7 years of work experience in technical marketing or another customer\-facing role, ideally at a company building dev tools. In this role, you’ll take the initiative to work with different people across our business as well as customers, and having some prior work experience in a similar corporate or startup environment will give you a headstart.
* You have a CSS background and you’ve worked in B2B SaaS or a dev tools company, or have experience working on a product for developers.
* You’ve built technical content or collateral to support a sales team.
* You’re excited to work in a startup. Our product is always evolving, and so does our work and our priorities. We stay nimble as we try new things to grow the business.

Click Therapeutics also complies with all applicable national, state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment as well as employment eligibility verification requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act. All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U. S. For certain classes of temporary visas, the resulting work authorization may be specific to Click Therapeutics and the specific job and/or work site. Click Therapeutics may at its business discretion decide to or refrain from obtaining, maintaining and/or extending the temporary visa status and/or sponsoring a colleague for permanent residency and /or employment eligibility, considering factors such as availability of qualified U.S. workers and the colleague's long\-term prospects for securing lawful permanent residence, among other reasons. Employment applicants requiring immigration sponsorship must disclose, when initial application for employment is made, whether or not they are legally authorized to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. and, if so, whether that authorization permits them to work in the job they seek. In no case should Click Therapeutics support of a colleague's temporary visa application or sponsorship of a colleague for permanent residence be construed to guarantee success of that application or amend or otherwise invalidate the ""at\-will"" employment relationship between the colleague and Click Therapeutics.


**Recruitment Phishing Scams:**



Fake job advertisements and offers are increasingly appearing on the internet. If you have encountered a job posting or have been approached with a job offer that you suspect may be fraudulent, we strongly recommend you do not respond and report it to the Federal Trade Commission and the FBI at https://www.ic3\.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice.

ChowNow is one of the leading players in off\-premise restaurant technology. As takeout becomes a vital revenue stream for independent restaurants, our platform helps owners focus on what they do best—serving great food—by offering solutions across the entire digital dining experience. From building branded websites and mobile apps, to powering online orders, managing menus, consolidating delivery, and running targeted marketing, we give restaurants the tools to grow on their own terms.  

We support over **20,000 restaurants across North America**, helping process **$1B\+ in gross food sales** while saving our partners over **$700M in third\-party commission fees**. Through our white\-label ordering solutions, a growing demand network (including Google, Yelp, Apple, and Snap), and a diner\-friendly marketplace, we empower independent restaurants to own their customer relationships and avoid inflated pricing and fees charged by 3rd party delivery apps like Uber and Doordash.  

Founded in 2012, we’ve navigated rapid growth and transformation—from startup roots through the pandemic boom—and are now beginning an exciting new era under our **CEO, Kanika Soni**. As we evolve with new leadership and cutting\-edge tools, we’re deepening our commitment to helping local restaurants thrive in the digital economy. **About the Position:**  

This is a rare opportunity to join a mission oriented company at a pivotal moment in its journey. What makes this role truly unique is the breadth and depth of exposure you’ll gain.  

As Growth Strategy Manager, you’ll work directly with the executive team on the most critical strategic questions facing the business. One month you might be embedded with Sales and Marketing to optimize our go\-to\-market strategy, and the next you could be quarterbacking a cross\-functional initiative with the Product \& CX teams. Some projects will be short\-cycle—identifying and sizing an opportunity before handing it off—while others will require full ownership from strategy through execution.  

This opportunity is perfectly aligned with a highly analytical, action\-oriented former consultant who wants to transition from strategy to impact, and is eager to learn how every part of a scaling business works.

* Within your first 7 days, ship designs ready for implementation


**What we're looking for**


* 3\+ years of full\-time design experience
* Portfolio that showcases shipped work
* Comfort building for an engineering persona, with enough technical literacy to discuss APIs, data flows, and constraints

* Ability to work autonomously in a fast\-paced environment, where ""just enough process"" is the goal and without a formal PM structure or formal product documentation
* Fluent in Figma

* Experience designing for developer tools or data\-heavy B2B products
* Familiarity with SQL, Python, data engineering, or machine\-learning workflows
* Dabbled with front\-end code (HTML/CSS, React, or TypeScript)

	+ Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels.

--------------



Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that everyone can code, not just \~0\.1% of the population.



Everything is changing in how software gets built, and Sourcegraph builds tools that make it easier at scale. Code Search helps devs explore and understand massive codebases. Amp, our agentic coding tool, dramatically accelerates the time it takes to write new code and tackle complex problems like migrating and transforming code.



We're trusted by engineering teams at leading companies like Stripe, Uber, and Palo Alto Networks, and with $225M in funding from investors like a16z, Sequoia, and Redpoint, we are building the tools that will define the next era of enterprise software development. We're a globally distributed team with a culture of high agency, direct communication, and deep love for developers.



If you want to work at the bleeding edge of software and do the most meaningful work of your career, join us.

**Location**
------------



 While we hire almost anywhere in the world, we have a strong preference for someone to reside in the following locations for this role. However, if you feel qualified, we welcome you to apply regardless of location. No matter what, working hours must overlap with PST for at least 30 hours/week.


**Preferred locations:**


* San Francisco, CA
* Denver, CO

  


**Why this job is exciting**
----------------------------



As a Product Marketing Manager at Sourcegraph, you will become an expert in one of the hottest current market opportunities: generative AI for developer tools. This is a competitive space, and Product Marketing's role to define our product narrative and deliver crisp content is critical to our success. If you're interested in working in the intersection of generative AI, dev tools, and Marketing (messaging, storytelling, and sales enablement), then this role is for you.



In this role, you'll work collaboratively with Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Sales teams.You will be a key content creator with an emphasis on all things technical. You will be a key content creator within the Marketing team and focus deeply on individual devs and our enterprise customers. You will create technical blogs, whitepapers, reports, and slide decks for marketing and sales support. You will also craft demo flows, talk tracks, and live content that highlight our product's strengths and lean into trends and use cases for devs and generative AI.



You will help us tell more stories about how customers use our products and own analyst relations for Sourcegraph. You'll establish a tight feedback loop between Sales, Product, and Marketing. Your understanding of our products and the feedback of our customers will inform our marketing strategy and the content we create in the generative AI space.



While we're a small company and ownership and priorities change often, these are the main areas you'll be responsible for:


* Technical product content (videos \& written content)
* Product\-specific support:
* + Bi\-weekly \& monthly release GTM
	+ Cody
	+ Amp (shared)
* Lead analyst relations
* Support customer marketing
* Product\-led growth (shared)
* Content \& thought leadership (shared)


This role has lots of potential to deepen our company's understanding of generative AI and our brand in the space. This person will be strategic in how they help build our product narrative. This role will also be tactical, and we will look to this PMM to help us move quickly and create content to help grow developers' love for and awareness of Cody every week, particularly among the enterprise segment.



 Within one month, you will…


* Become an expert on our product, including its strengths and limitations.
* Take over analyst relations, maintaining relationships with industry experts across top firms.
* Begin researching new use cases for AI in the developer ecosystem, including through customer calls, to bring new insights back to the Marketing team.


 Within three months, you will…


* Regularly join customer calls and calls with the Sales team.
* Report learnings and insights back to the Marketing team in weekly team check\-ins.
* Publish several deeply technical blog posts that unpack use cases and best practices for using generative AI for code.
* Support our Product team with key launch moments.
* Contribute to the website (sourcegraph.com), and work with the rest of the Product Marketing team to build out new webpages using your learnings on product use cases.


 Within six months, you will…


* Build out content for, and present in, webinars for our prospects.
* Deliver best practices resources to the Sales and Customer Engineering teams. For example, this could be a whitepaper outlining where and when Cody or Amp is best used for different languages and common development tasks (such as code modernization or unit testing).


 Within one year, you will…


* Establish a formal feedback loop process between Sales, Marketing, and Product teams.
* Consistently deliver high\-quality technical content materials that delight developers and speak to an enterprise audience.
* Create and maintain a demo flow and talk track for Cody that is commonly used by sellers in the field and marketers at trade shows.

  


**About you**
-------------



You have a technical background and a passion for working with customers and understanding the go\-to\-market strategy side of a business. You also have a strong interest in generative AI and its applications and are excited to do research in the area. You're a natural storyteller with strong communication skills and an interest in B2B technology or dev tools.



Must haves:


* You enjoy writing and consider yourself a strong writer. Much of the work of product marketers involves communicating ideas effectively in writing, so this skill is critical to the PMM role.
* You have some experience with code and building apps. You use AI coding assistants yourself and know the landscape and have your favorites. This could be writing code professionally, or familiarity through schoolwork or as a hobby. Our products are all about making developers' lives easier as they write code, so a basic understanding of code will be critical to your product expertise and empathy for developers.
* You're excited about a high\-agency role. A lot of this role will be work that is done for the first time (for example, interviewing customers and sellers to compile research on new use cases for generative AI). There is *lots* of room for high\-agency, strategic thinking, and creative approaches in this role.
* You've worked in an environment with a product\-led growth model.
* You're ready to roll up your sleeves and do both strategic and tactical work. As the PMM in this role, you will do research and help with narrative storytelling, but you'll spend even more time writing content, getting on calls with customers, and occasionally running webinars. Everyone on Sourcegraph's marketing team gets hands\-on with building content, all the way up to the CMO!


Nice\-to\-haves:


* You have 5\-7 years of work experience in technical marketing or another customer\-facing role, ideally at a company building dev tools. In this role, you'll take the initiative to work with different people across our business as well as customers, and having some prior work experience in a similar corporate or startup environment will give you a headstart.
* You have a CSS background and you've worked in B2B SaaS or a dev tools company, or have experience working on a product for developers.
* You've built technical content or collateral to support a sales team.
* You're excited to work in a startup. Our product is always evolving, and so does our work and our priorities. We stay nimble as we try new things to grow the business.

**More about Hopper**


At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.


The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. he Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.


While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a travel fintech provider, commerce platform, and global travel agency that powers some of the world’s largest brands.


Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada, and many more.

	+ Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines and many more.

Headquartered out of Denver, CO, Spekit is transforming how B2B revenue teams learn, work, and grow. We're building the next\-generation enablement platform for the AI era, delivering just\-in\-time, personalized enablement, and relevant guidance directly within the daily workflows of sales, customer success, and other crucial revenue teams. Our AI\-powered solution empowers companies like Southwest Airlines, Uber Freight, and ZoomInfo to close more deals, accelerate rep ramp times, and ultimately boost revenue by ensuring their people always have the information they need, precisely when they need it. Say goodbye to information overload and hello to *Simple, yet Spektacular* performance.  

About the Role
Reporting directly to our CEO, Melanie Fellay, we’re adding a *brand new* role to the team! We’re looking for a Go\-to\-Market (GTM) Enablement Architect to be a bridge between solutions consulting, revenue enablement, and operational efficiency for our sales team.

As a power user of Spekit, you’ll take full ownership of our org, continuously optimizing it to showcase our latest capabilities. You’ll also enable our revenue team (including pre and post sales teams), equipping them with the messaging, training, and best practices to excel in their roles. And finally, you’ll directly support sales—helping reps craft the perfect demo strategy or even jumping into calls to lead the demo yourself if needed.  

If you’re a former seller with a passion for enablement, an eye for optimization \& process, and a love for helping teams \& customers perform at their best, this role is for you. *Want to see how Melanie describes the role?* *Here*
### **What You’ll Do**

You'll foster an environment where our team is proud to showcase our internal use of Spekit on any customer call and one where Spekit is used internally for every enablement need, from Onboarding to Product Launch.
* **Elevate Content \& Enablement Excellence:** You'll continuously keep internal training and content fresh, ensuring our team follows best practices and is always equipped with the latest messaging and competitive positioning. This includes creating and managing impactful product demo videos that resonate with customers and prospects. You'll partner closely with Product Marketers and Product Managers to embed new messaging and sales processes into our enablement.
* **Architect World\-Class Demos \& Drive Product Storytelling:** You'll own and continuously evolve our demo environment, transforming it into a **world\-class showcase** of Spekit's cutting\-edge capabilities. This involves building compelling, up\-to\-date demo use cases that highlight our latest product innovations and effectively convey Spekit's value. You'll lead demo certifications and ongoing training for the sales team, ensuring they master the art of the Spekit demo.
* **Act as a Strategic Sales Advisor \& In\-Call Catalyst:** You'll be a trusted advisor to the sales team, partnering with them to refine their approach ahead of key calls. You're not afraid to **jump into critical sales calls** to deliver high\-impact demos, helping reps navigate complex conversations and confidently position Spekit. You'll proactively listen to call recordings (beyond AI summaries) to truly ""hear"" objections and identify nuanced enablement needs.
* **Uncover Insights \& Optimize Performance:** You'll manage and optimize Spekit's internal use, ensuring strategic alignment and consistency across teams. You've got serious ""ops chops"" and a love for data, enabling you to pull your own reports and dive deep into performance metrics. You'll obsess over ""what's working"" and ""what isn't"" to deeply understand the root causes of performance challenges, translating data into actionable enablement strategies.

We're truly obsessed with serving Healthcare Professionals (aka Awesome Humans), and the right candidate will be, too.



If you've been at this for a minute, maybe job descriptions with the words ""rockstar"" and ""ninja"" make you want to gouge your eyes out. We think that's a great place to start this conversation.



Instead: You're a Writer (with a capital W) who has opinions about the Oxford comma and em dashes. You're culture\-obsessed (bonus points if you love The Pitt) and are wildly self\-motivated, a brilliant collaborator, and suuuper detail\-oriented.



Day to day, you'll be writing and editing copy for assets on a global scale—think scripts, ads, emails, OOH, and more. You'll also be in the details—sweating over the small things like ensuring that every product description page is accurate, typos are a thing of the past, and that subject lines are so dialed in that the ""mark as read"" button doesn't stand a chance.



This role reports directly to the Narrative Director.


**What you'll do:**


* Compose branded content that fits within creative briefs for campaigns and product launches
* Ensure copy is aligned with the brand's 100% Awesome tone of voice within content deliverables, and leverage web analytics, customer insights, and user feedback to ensure that what we're writing matters.
* Partner with designers, producers, and project managers to align copy with visuals and ensure deliverables hit the brief
* Collaborate and craft copy for all sorts of assets. One day you'll be writing a suite of product descriptions, the next you'll be writing bespoke podcast ads to better connect with Awesome Humans.


**Qualifications:**


* Bachelor's degree, preferably with a degree in English, Communications, or Journalism
* 4\+ years of copywriting experience in an agency or in\-house for a brand
* An interest in fashion
* A background in copywriting and content production
* You're what others would describe as ""very online""
* Familiarity with SEO best practices


**Other must haves:**


* You've got a sense of humor (or three)
* You're excellent at problem\-solving on your own, but not afraid to ask questions when you need to
* You love a fast\-paced environment (like…really fast paced)
* You're looking for a company you can grow with
* You love a company with a real purpose that stands by its values
* You're 100% Awesome. Just like our scrubs.


**FIGS Compensation and Benefits**


*Pay Range*


* At FIGS, your base salary is one part of your total compensation package. This role's base salary range is between $73,000 and $105,000\. Actual base salary is determined based on a number of factors, including but not limited to your relevant skills, qualifications, and years of experience.


*Additional Compensation and Benefits*


* FIGS provides a discount when purchasing FIGS stock voluntarily through our FIGS Employee Stock Purchase Plan
* Other compensation and benefits offered include:
* + Comprehensive benefits and perks package focused on your well\-being, including premium medical, dental and vision coverage, and full access to wellness services through Breethe and Classpass. 100% FIGS\-sponsored life insurance and disability insurance
	+ Amazing 401(k) program, with a company match up to the first 6% of your contribution

By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.


The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. he Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

* Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.


Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders.

	+ Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.


Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels.

 **About the Role**


We are seeking a GSI Partner Lead to build and scale a high\-performing **Global Systems Integrator (GSI)** channel that accelerates revenue through new logo acquisition, co\-sell execution, and services alignment. This role is designed for a strategic operator and relationship builder who can architect scalable programs while driving impact with executives \& their teams.


You’ll own the end\-to\-end lifecycle of GSI acquisition and activation — from identifying strategic partners and launching joint go\-to\-market programs, to generating pipelines and building multi\-threaded relationships across sales, delivery, and alliance teams. You will report to Ramp’s Head of Partnerships and work cross\-functionally across sales, marketing, product, and enablement, along with Ramp’s executive leadership.

**What You’ll Do**

**GSI Strategy \& Acquisition**

* Define Ramp’s GSI channel strategy across ERP\-aligned ecosystems (e.g., NetSuite, Sage, Microsoft, QuickBooks, etc.).
* Prioritize and Tier 1 target GSIs and engage Tier 2: Accenture, EY) based on strategic potential and relationship maturity.
* Build customized acquisition plans with stakeholder maps, executive introduction strategies, and business case development.

 **Multi\-Threaded Relationship Management**

* Build deep, multi\-functional relationships with GSI leadership, alliance managers, field sellers, and services leaders.
* Align Ramp value with GSI go\-to\-market and service offerings, including co\-sell motions, onboarding delivery, and integration consulting.
* Take what you learn and communicate it to cross\-functional stakeholders to drive better alignment across the Ramp / GSI partnership.

**Program Design \& GTM Execution**

* Lead the creation and launch of lightweight GTM plans, co\-branded enablement, and joint account mapping campaigns.
* Partner with marketing to build scalable messaging, case studies, and co\-hosted events/webinars.
* Establish partner training, certification, and incentive frameworks that reward impact and create repeatable success.

 **Pipeline \& Revenue Ownership**

* Drive GSI\-sourced SQLs, pipeline, and closed\-won revenue across ERP ecosystems.
* Collaborate with sales ops to implement forecasting, attribution, and pipeline tracking.
* Optimize co\-sell plays and influence motions with clear reporting, partner attribution models, and feedback loops.

**What You Need**

* 8\+ years experience in partnerships, business development, or strategic alliances — ideally with GSIs, ERPs, or fintech/SaaS ecosystems.
* Proven ability to build GTM plans, drive pipeline, and navigate complex, matrixed partner organizations.
* Deep understanding of services partner models and co\-sell strategies.
* Comfort with CRM/PRM tools, pipeline reporting, and cross\-functional program development.
* Executive presence and communication skills that inspire trust and clarity across stakeholders.

**Nice to Haves**

* Think like a builder and operator — you’re energized by ambiguity and creating from scratch.
* Have a passion for technology, business transformation, and unlocking value for both Ramp and our partners.
* Love collaborating cross\-functionally with sales, marketing, product, enablement, and finance teams.
* Measure your success through impact — you track the numbers, learn fast, and always look to optimize.

 *For candidates located in NYC or SF, the pay range for this role is $205,000 \- $300,000\. For candidates located in all other locations, the pay range for this role is $185,000\-$270,000\.*

* Maintain clean, accurate Hubspot CRM hygiene and sales documentation
* Monitor activity performance data and use it to drive your day\-to\-day priorities

===============

* You have 5\+ years of experience in SaaS or tech sales (automotive vendor or adjacent B2B a plus)
* You’re used to owning a number and know how to build a territory from the ground up
* You thrive in outbound sales and know how to find, pursue, and close new business
* You’re confident in the sales process — discovery, solution selling, negotiation, and closing

* You understand or are curious about AI and can clearly articulate how it solves real\-world problems
* You’re coachable, direct, and committed to doing excellent work in a fast\-paced environment
* You have used Hubspot, Slack and can navigate and learn a internal tech stack.

**What Success Looks Like**
===========================

* You and your BDR consistently hit (or exceed) your monthly and quarterly quota
* You maintain a healthy pipeline with consistent movement through each stage
* You deliver accurate forecasts and hit your targets with discipline
* You earn trust across the org — leadership sees you as someone who owns your patch
* You close net\-new logos and set a strong foundation for long\-term dealer partnerships

Ramp has been named to Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list and LinkedIn’s Top U.S. Startups for more than 3 years, as well as the Forbes Cloud 100, CNBC Disruptor 50, and TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential Companies.

 **About the Role**


Ramp is one of the fastest growing startups in history. Much of that success comes down to how fast we build. Our engineers ship features in days, not months – and fix bugs in hours, not weeks. We move at High.Speed.Velocity and take our work, not ourselves, seriously. Now, we're ready for someone who can tell a story capturing it all. That's where you come in.


We’re looking for our first Product and Partner Communications hire at Ramp, reporting to the Head of Communications. This role comes with a lot of freedom and responsibility. While you won’t be building from scratch, there’s a lot to get creative around.


Our ideal candidate is someone who is a product manager at heart (and just so happens to be amazing at the written word). Your best day is one where you capture the essence of what a product is about so that customers, analysts, and employees understand its true value. You move fast but methodically: you know how to balance building a long\-term narrative with executing quickly in the here and now. And you’re multilingual, able to speak the language of engineers, customers, product leads, and analysts. If you have fintech experience, that’s a massive plus.


If this sounds like you, we’d love to talk!


This role is ideally based out of either New York, San Francisco, or Miami – but is open to remote.

**What You’ll Do**

* Product and partner communications
	+ Own the creation of our product and partner narrative, developing messaging that clearly communicates Ramp’s value proposition to our key audiences.
	+ Collaborate with Product, Product/Partner Marketing, and Engineering to build a launch calendar and set of criteria for communicating new products, features, and partner momentum.
	+ Identify high\-impact media opportunities and secure placements in relevant outlets for our audiences.
	+ Build strong relationships with key journalists and social media influencers.
	+ Collaborate with the rest of Communications and Brand Marketing to create written, visual, and video content that makes product news fun and memorable (let’s get some personality in there!).
	+ Prepare executives and subject matter experts ahead of media or speaking engagements.
* Analyst relations
	+ Build an AR program that ensures strong performance in core areas and helps us expand to additional market categories.
	+ Identify and engage with key industry analysts and firms. Establish and nurture strong relationships through regular updates, briefings, and events.
	+ Prepare Ramp executives for analyst interactions with briefing materials and key messaging.
	+ Leverage analyst feedback internally to inform communications, sales enablement, product marketing, and development.
	+ Analyze the impact of AR activities on market perception and business outcomes.

**What You Need**

* 8\+ years experience in communications or related fields.
* Succinct writing skills that infuse personality and humanity (i.e., you write like people talk).
* High technical acumen.
* Experience in or high desire to learn about fintech.
* A creative spirit, with an ability to story\-tell across mediums, including video, visual design, and the written word.

**Nice to Haves**

* Experience in video production, editing, or graphic design.
* Experience in analyst relations.

**Compensation**

*For candidates located in NYC or SF, the pay range for this role is $158,500 \- $217,900\.*

*For candidates located in all other locations, the pay range for this role is $142,600 \- $196,150\.*

**Benefits (for U.S.\-based full\-time employees)**

* 100% medical, dental \& vision insurance coverage for you
	+ Partially covered for your dependents
	+ One Medical annual membership
* 401k (including employer match on contributions made while employed by Ramp)
* Flexible PTO
* Fertility HRA (up to $5,000 per year)
* WFH stipend to support your home office needs
* Wellness stipend
* Parental Leave
* Relocation support to NYC or SF
* Pet insurance

As a Product Manager on the Uber Grocery Delivery Experience team, you'll play a key role in creating a flawless fulfillment experience that gets customers anything they order from local merchants. Uber to date has successfully helped customers get restaurant food delivered to their doors, and we are excited to bring that delight and convenience to virtually everything else.
  

  

Today, we're focused on the grocery, convenience, and alcohol sectors, while expanding into more verticals like retail. Customers demand that their orders arrive accurately, on\-time and with minimal interventions on their part. To accomplish this, you will define and execute the product strategy to ensure that the shopper experience is simple, while prioritizing accuracy and quality \- every time.
  

  

In this role, you will be working with a broad set of cross\-functional stakeholders across operations, data science, design, engineering, marketing and more, to deliver a reliable and delightful shopping experience.
  

  

**What the Candidate Will Do**  

  

The opportunities to evolve the shopper experience are myriad and we are only just getting started. This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling together with the team you're leading:
  

* Understand the needs of our Earners, potential Earners, as well as various lines of business to define the vision, strategy, and roadmap for your product area
* Ensure that couriers are sufficiently prepared to handle complex orders and be able to provide them live support in a scaled, tech\-driven way while they are shopping and delivering
* Be a thought leader for ways to ensure fulfillment success across all levers, from pricing and incentives to courier education, rewards and data transparency
* Collaborating with our regional operations and sales teams to deeply understand the market nuances and pain\-points related to fulfillment \- and then devising and executing product solutions to solve them
Influencing the product roadmaps of many other teams across Uber that work to onboard Earners, manage their trip experience and match them with orders  
* 

  

  

**Basic Qualifications**  

  

* Minimum 3 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them
* Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner's problems
* Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands\-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the metal
* Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the checkout process
* Finger\-tippiness with data. You find a way to get the data you need and whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage this data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis
* A Driver"" mindset. You are biased toward action, a great collaborator, a master disambiguator/simplifier, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
* A high bar across the board \- from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on
A never\-ending desire to grow and learn  
* 

  

  

**Preferred Qualifications**  

  

* Experience building products from 0 to 1
* Experience in the grocery, retail, CPG or ecommerce industry
Fulfillment and/or Marketplace experience. You would have directly worked on fulfillment, logistics, delivery or other last mile problems, or have strong knowledge of how marketplaces (where multiple parties transact on a platform you've had a hand in building) work

*“Whatever you do – whether for work or pleasure – do it with passion! Live with passion,”* wrote Christian Dior.
  

Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23\. In 1938 he learned the métier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.",Retail,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Christian-Dior,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/dad2d4518ae5ab7218bebf0c965b2646,https://www.dior.com/,"30 avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris","1,001 to 5,000",$500M to $1B (USD),,,,,,,

We are honored to be recognized as a multi\-award winning organization. Talroo has been consistently recognized as a Top Workplace and a Best Place to Work in Austin. We've been ranked the last five years by Inc. 500/5000 as one of the fastest growing companies in the U.S. You'll also find us on the Austin Business Journal's Fast 50 growth awards list multiple times. We're growing the right way, and we need exceptional talent to help us build upon our successful story.



Talroo is helping organizations like Uber, McDonald's, UPS, The Home Depot, Target and more, find and hire their essential workforces. Our data\-driven job and hiring event recruiting platform turns the Internet into a help wanted sign. Our pay\-for\-performance model enables customers to maximize efficiency, not waste spend, and hire employees faster than they could with any of our competitors.  

  

Rather than drive customers to a destination site, Talroo uses a consumer marketing approach to deliver job opportunities to candidates where they are already spending time online. Similar to what Google AdSense and Facebook Ad Networks do for their advertisers, Talroo uncovers the right candidates that companies are looking to hire.  

  

Talroo leverages a search\-and\-match algorithm powered by state\-of\-the\-art AI technologies. Our deep\-learning processes analyze billions of signals daily, assessing the job seeker\-employer relationship in real time. This produces significantly better search results for the job seekers, and higher quality applicant matches for the employer.



While we focus on providing amazing results and service for our customers, within our exciting company you'll also find a high\-performance environment of collaboration, encouragement, transparency and fun.


**About the position:**



Sales Engineers manage the day\-to\-day performance of Talroo's customers while striving to maximize ROI and lifetime customer value. You will be the authority on data, optimization, and support establishing your customers as raving fans of Talroo. Learn and sharpen your SQL skills and diagnose integration issues using products like Postman. You will help onboard some of the nation's top companies working in partnership with Account Executives, Account Managers and fellow sales engineers to present a cohesive, team\-oriented approach to customers.



We are looking to hire someone who has a competitive spirit who strives to be a top performer— an entrepreneurial self\-starter who requires minimal supervision with excellent communication skills and high curiosity. You are motivated to find solutions to challenges as they occur. You have a genuine interest in delivering the right solution, to the right client, every single time. You're eager to learn from failures \- not just from successes.



This position is fully in\-office, Monday through Friday, from 9:00am\-5:30pm. Our office is in northwest Austin, TX near the intersection of 360 and 2222 (about 8 miles from downtown).



Relocation reimbursement is offered for this role if moving from outside the greater Austin, TX area.



Compensation range for this position will be $80k\-$120k depending on total factors.


**Note:** Final round of interviews will take place on\-site at our Austin, TX headquarters (no virutal option). Depending on location, Talroo will cover flight, hotel, and local transportation/food costs, or will reimburse a mileage fee if within driving distance.

  


**As a Sales Engineer at Talroo, you will:**


* Accurately onboard clients in the Talroo platform
* Continually monitor dedicated accounts and make optimizations (bids, budgets, segmentation and overall ROI) to facilitate best performance and consistent improvement, budget fulfillment and overall client retention quarter over quarter
* Work cooperatively and in the spirt of Talroo's values to learn from and share knowledge with coworkers

You will be responsible for partnering with global teams around the company to understand how the catalog can power each experience and develop a strategy to grow and enrich Uber's product catalog.

	+ Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process
	+ Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner's problems

	+ Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands\-on
	+ A high bar across the board \- from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on
